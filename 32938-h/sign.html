<p>Errors and inconsistencies specific to this article:</p>

<div class = "list">
<p>Missing or misplaced periods adjoining a close parenthesis were
silently regularized.</p>
<p>In the List of Illustrations, “Ib.” and “Do.”/“do.” were
consistently printed without final period; it has been supplied
by the transcriber.</p>
<p>Inconsistent accentuation of “Natci”/“Nátci” is unchanged, as is
the variable punctuation (comma or period) between a book’s title
and place of publication.</p>
<p>The terms “jr.” and “sr.” are always printed in lower case.</p>

<!-- note by Bill Flis -->

<p>The verses in the section on Gestures of Actors are loosely quoted
from “The Rosciad” by Charles Churchill, which more accurately
reads:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“When to enforce some very tender part,</p>
<p>The right hand slips by instinct on the heart,</p>
<p>His soul, of every other thought bereft,</p>

INTRODUCTORY.</a></h3>

<p>During the past two years the present writer has devoted the
intervals between official duties to collecting and collating materials
for the study of sign language. As the few publications on the general
subject, possessing more than historic interest, are meager in details
and vague in expression, original investigation has been necessary. The
high development of communication by gesture among the tribes of North
America, and its continued extensive use by many of them, naturally
directed the first researches to that continent, with the result that a
large body of facts procured from collaborators and by personal
examination has now been gathered and classified. A&nbsp;correspondence
has also been established with many persons in other parts of the world
whose character and situation rendered it probable that they would
contribute valuable information. The success of that correspondence has
been as great as could have been expected, considering that most of the
persons addressed were at distant points sometimes not easily accessible
by mail. As the collection of facts is still successfully proceeding,
not only with reference to foreign peoples and to deaf-mutes everywhere,
but also among some American tribes not yet thoroughly examined in this
respect, no exposition of the subject pretending to be complete can yet
be made. In complying, therefore, with the request to prepare the
present paper, it is necessary to explain to correspondents and
collaborators whom it may reach, that this is not the comprehensive
publication by the Bureau of Ethnology for which their assistance has
been solicited. With this explanation some of those who have already
forwarded contributions will not be surprised at their omission, and
others will not desist from the work in which they are still kindly
engaged, under the impression that its results will not be received in
time to meet with welcome and credit. On the contrary, the urgent appeal
for aid before addressed to
<span class = "pagenum">270</span>
<a name = "page270" id = "page270"> </a>
officers of the Army and Navy of this and other nations, to
missionaries, travelers, teachers of deaf-mutes, and philologists
generally, is now with equal urgency repeated. It is, indeed, hoped that
the continued presentation of the subject to persons either having
opportunity for observation or the power to favor with suggestions may,
by awakening some additional interest in it, secure new collaboration
from localities still unrepresented.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood by other readers that, as the limits
assigned to this paper permit the insertion of but a small part of the
material already collected and of the notes of study made upon that
accumulation, it can only show the general scope of the work undertaken,
and not its accomplishment. Such extracts from the collection have been
selected as were regarded as most illustrative, and they are preceded by
a discussion perhaps sufficient to be suggestive, though by no means
exhaustive, and designed to be for popular, rather than for scientific
use. In short, the direction to submit a progress-report and not a
monograph has been complied with.</p>


<h3><a name = "sign_divisions" id = "sign_divisions">
DIVISIONS OF GESTURE SPEECH.</a></h3>

<p>These are corporeal motion and facial expression. An attempt has been
made by some writers to discuss these general divisions separately, and
its success would be practically convenient if it were always understood
that their connection is so intimate that they can never be altogether
severed. A&nbsp;play of feature, whether instinctive or voluntary,
accentuates and qualifies all motions intended to serve as signs, and
strong instinctive facial expression is generally accompanied by action
of the body or some of its members. But, so far as a distinction can be
made, expressions of the features are the result of emotional, and
corporeal gestures, of intellectual action. The former in general and
the small number of the latter that are distinctively emotional are
nearly identical among men from physiological causes which do not affect
with the same similarity the processes of thought. The large number of
corporeal gestures expressing intellectual operations require and admit
of more variety and conventionality. Thus the features and the body
among all mankind act almost uniformly in exhibiting fear, grief,
surprise, and shame, but all objective conceptions are varied and
variously portrayed. Even such simple indications as those for “no” and
“yes” appear in several differing motions. While, therefore, the terms
sign language and gesture speech necessarily include and suppose facial
expression when emotions are in question, they refer more particularly
to corporeal motions and attitudes. For this reason much of the valuable
contribution of <span class = "smallcaps">Darwin</span> in his
<i>Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</i> is not directly
applicable to sign language. His analysis
<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
<a name = "page271" id = "page271"> </a>
of emotional gestures into those explained on the principles of
serviceable associated habits, of antithesis, and of the constitution of
the nervous system, should, nevertheless, always be remembered. Even if
it does not strictly embrace the class of gestures which form the
subject of this paper, and which often have an immediate pantomimic
origin, the earliest gestures were doubtless instinctive and generally
emotional, preceding pictorial, metaphoric, and, still subsequent,
conventional gestures even, as, according to <span class =
"smallcaps">Darwin’s</span> cogent reasoning, they preceded articulate
speech.</p>

<p>While the distinction above made between the realm of facial play and
that of motions of the body, especially those of the arms and hands, is
sufficiently correct for use in discussion, it must be admitted that the
features do express intellect as well as emotion. The well-known saying
of Charles Lamb that “jokes came in with the candles” is in point, but
the most remarkable example of conveying detailed information without
the use of sounds, hands, or arms, is given by the late President
T.&nbsp;H. Gallaudet, the distinguished instructor of deaf-mutes, which,
to be intelligible, requires to be quoted at length:</p>

<p>“One day, our distinguished and lamented historical painter, Col.
John Trumbull, was in my school-room during the hours of instruction,
and, on my alluding to the <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: error for ‘talent’?">tact</ins> which the pupil referred to
had of reading my face, he expressed a wish to see it tried.
I&nbsp;requested him to select any event in Greek, Roman, English, or
American history of a scenic character, which would make a striking
picture on canvas, and said I would endeavor to communicate it to the
lad. ‘Tell him,’ said he, ‘that Brutus (Lucius Junius) condemned his two
sons to death for resisting his authority and violating his orders.’</p>

<p>“I folded my arms in front of me, and kept them in that position, to
preclude the possibility of making any signs or gestures, or of spelling
any words on my fingers, and proceeded, as best I could, by the
expression of my countenance, and a few motions of my head and attitudes
of the body, to convey the picture in my own mind to the mind of my
pupil.</p>

<p>“It ought to be stated that he was already acquainted with the fact,
being familiar with the leading events in Roman history. But when I
began, he knew not from what portion of history, sacred or profane,
ancient or modern, the fact was selected. From this wide range, my
delineation on the one hand and his ingenuity on the other had to bring
it within the division of Roman history, and, still more minutely, to
the particular individual and transaction designated by Colonel
Trumbull. In carrying on the process, I&nbsp;made no use whatever of any
arbitrary, conventional look, motion, or attitude, before settled
between us, by which to let him understand what I wished to communicate,
with the exception of a single one, if, indeed, it ought to be
considered such.</p>

<p>“The usual sign, at that time, among the teachers and pupils, for a
Roman, was portraying an aquiline nose by placing the fore-finger,
<span class = "pagenum">272</span>
<a name = "page272" id = "page272"> </a>
crooked, in front of the nose. As I was prevented from using my finger
in this way, and having considerable command over the muscles of my
face, I&nbsp;endeavored to give my nose as much of the aquiline form as
possible, and succeeded well enough for my purpose. <span class =
"ellipsis">***</span></p>

<p>“The outlines of the process were the following:</p>

<p>“A stretching and stretching gaze eastward, with an undulating motion
of the head, as if looking across and beyond the Atlantic Ocean, to
denote that the event happened, not on the western, but eastern
continent. This was making a little progress, as it took the subject out
of the range of American history.</p>

<p>“A turning of the eyes upward and backward, with frequently-repeated
motions of the head backward, as if looking a great way back in past
time, to denote that the event was one of ancient date.</p>

<p>“The aquiline shape of the nose, already referred to, indicating that
a Roman was the person concerned. It was, of course, an old Roman.</p>

<p>“Portraying, as well as I could, by my countenance, attitude, and
manner an individual high in authority, and commanding others, as if he
expected to be obeyed.</p>

<p>“Looking and acting as if I were giving out a specific order to many
persons, and threatening punishment on those who should resist my
authority, even the punishment of death.</p>

<p>“Here was a pause in the progress of events, which I denoted by
sleeping as it were during the night and awakening in the morning, and
doing this several times, to signify that several days had elapsed.</p>

<p>“Looking with deep interest and surprise, as if at a single person
brought and standing before me, with an expression of countenance
indicating that he had violated the order which I had given, and that I
knew it. Then looking in the same way at another person near him as also
guilty. Two offending persons were thus denoted.</p>

<p>“Exhibiting serious deliberation, then hesitation, accompanied with
strong conflicting emotions, producing perturbation, as if I knew not
how to feel or what to do.</p>

<p>“Looking first at one of the persons before me, and then at the
other, and then at both together, <i>as a father would look</i>,
indicating his distressful parental feelings under such afflicting
circumstances.</p>

<p>“Composing my feelings, showing that a change was coming over me, and
exhibiting towards the imaginary persons before me the decided look of
the inflexible commander, who was determined and ready to order them
away to execution. Looking and acting as if the tender and forgiving
feelings of <i>the father</i> had again got the ascendency, and as if I
was about to relent and pardon them.</p>

<p>“These alternating states of mind I portrayed several times, to make
my representations the more graphic and impressive.</p>

<p>“At length the father yields, and the stern principle of justice, as
expressed in my countenance and manners, prevails. My look and action
<span class = "pagenum">273</span>
<a name = "page273" id = "page273"> </a>
denote the passing of the sentence of death on the offenders, and the
ordering them away to execution.</p>

<p class = "ellipsis">
*******</p>

<p>“He quickly turned round to his slate and wrote a correct and
complete account of this story of Brutus and his two sons.”</p>

<p>While it appears that the expressions of the features are not
confined to the emotions or to distinguishing synonyms, it must be
remembered that the meaning of the same motion of hands, arms, and
fingers is often modified, individualized, or accentuated by associated
facial changes and postures of the body not essential to the sign, which
emotional changes and postures are at once the most difficult to
describe and the most interesting when intelligently reported, not only
because they infuse life into the skeleton sign, but because they may
belong to the class of innate expressions.</p>


<h3><a name = "sign_origin" id = "sign_origin">
THE ORIGIN OF SIGN LANGUAGE.</a></h3>

<p>In observing the maxim that nothing can be thoroughly understood
unless its beginning is known, it becomes necessary to examine into the
origin of sign language through its connection with that of oral speech.
In this examination it is essential to be free from the vague popular
impression that some oral language, of the general character of that now
used among mankind, is “natural” to mankind. It will be admitted on
reflection that all oral languages were at some past time far less
serviceable to those using them than they are now, and as each
particular language has been thoroughly studied it has become evident
that it grew out of some other and less advanced form. In the
investigation of these old forms it has been so difficult to ascertain
how any of them first became a useful instrument of inter-communication
that many conflicting theories on this subject have been advocated.</p>

<p>Oral language consists of variations and mutations of vocal sounds
produced as signs of thought and emotion. But it is not enough that
those signs should be available as the vehicle of the producer’s own
thoughts. They must be also efficient for the communication of such
thoughts to others. It has been, until of late years, generally held
that thought was not possible without oral language, and that, as man
was supposed to have possessed from the first the power of thought, he
also from the first possessed and used oral language substantially as at
present. That the latter, as a special faculty, formed the main
distinction between man and the brutes has been and still is the
prevailing doctrine. In a lecture delivered before the British
Association in 1878 it was declared that “animal intelligence is unable
to elaborate that class of abstract ideas, the formation of which
depends upon the faculty of speech.” If instead of “speech” the word
“utterance” had been used,
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
as including all possible modes of intelligent communication, the
statement might pass without criticism. But it may be doubted if there
is any more necessary connection between abstract ideas and sounds, the
mere signs of thought, that strike the ear, than there is between the
same ideas and signs addressed only to the eye.</p>

<p>The point most debated for centuries has been, not whether there was
any primitive oral language, but what that language was. Some
literalists have indeed argued from the Mosaic narrative that because
the Creator, by one supernatural act, with the express purpose to form
separate peoples, had divided all tongues into their present varieties,
and could, by another similar exercise of power, obliterate all but one
which should be universal, the fact that he had not exercised that power
showed it not to be his will that any man to whom a particular speech
had been given should hold intercourse with another miraculously set
apart from him by a different speech. By this reasoning, if the study of
a foreign tongue was not impious, it was at least clear that the
primitive language had been taken away as a disciplinary punishment, as
the Paradisiac Eden had been earlier lost, and that, therefore, the
search for it was as fruitless as to attempt the passage of the flaming
sword. More liberal Christians have been disposed to regard the Babel
story as allegorical, if not mythical, and have considered it to
represent the disintegration of tongues out of one which was primitive.
In accordance with the advance of linguistic science they have
successively shifted back the postulated primitive tongue from Hebrew to
Sanscrit, then to Aryan, and now seek to evoke from the vasty deeps of
antiquity the ghosts of other rival claimants for precedence in
dissolution. As, however, the languages of man are now recognized as
extremely numerous, and as the very sounds of which these several
languages are composed are so different that the speakers of some are
unable to distinguish with the ear certain sounds in others, still less
able to reproduce them, the search for one common parent language is
more difficult than was supposed by mediæval ignorance.</p>

<p>The discussion is now, however, varied by the suggested possibility
that man at some time may have existed without any oral language. It is
conceded by some writers that mental images or representations can be
formed without any connection with sound, and may at least serve for
thought, though not for expression. It is certain that concepts, however
formed, can be expressed by other means than sound. One mode of this
expression is by gesture, and there is less reason to believe that
gestures commenced as the interpretation of, or substitute for words
than that the latter originated in, and served to translate gestures.
Many arguments have been advanced to prove that gesture language
preceded articulate speech and formed the earliest attempt at
communication, resulting from the interacting subjective and objective
conditions to which primitive man was exposed. Some of the facts on
which deductions have been based, made in accordance with
well-established modes of scientific research from study of the lower
animals, children, idiots, the lower types of mankind, and deaf-mutes,
will be briefly mentioned.</p>

<h4><a name = "sign_origin_animals" id = "sign_origin_animals">
GESTURES OF THE LOWER ANIMALS.</a></h4>

<p>Emotional expression in the features of man is to be considered in
reference to the fact that the special senses either have their seat in,
or are in close relation to the face, and that so large a number of
nerves pass to it from the brain. The same is true of the lower animals,
so that it would be inferred, as is the case, that the faces of those
animals are also expressive of emotion. There is also noticed among them
an exhibition of emotion by corporeal action. This is the class of
gestures common to them with the earliest made by man, as above
mentioned, and it is reasonable to suppose that those were made by man
at the time when, if ever, he was, like the animals, destitute of
articulate speech. The articulate cries uttered by some animals,
especially some birds, are interesting as connected with the principle
of imitation to which languages in part owe their origin, but in the
cases of forced imitation, the mere acquisition of a vocal trick, they
only serve to illustrate that power of imitation, and are without
significance. Sterne’s starling, after his cage had been opened, would
have continued to complain that he could not get out. If the bird had
uttered an instinctive cry of distress when in confinement and a note of
joy on release, there would have been a nearer approach to language than
if it had clearly pronounced many sentences. Such notes and cries of
animals, many of which are connected with reproduction and nutrition,
are well worth more consideration than can now be given, but regarding
them generally it is to be questioned if they are so expressive as the
gestures of the same animals. It is contended that the bark of a dog is
distinguishable into fear, defiance, invitation, and a note of warning,
but it also appears that those notes have been known only since the
animal has been domesticated. The gestures of the dog are far more
readily distinguished than his bark, as in his preparing for attack, or
caressing his master, resenting an injury, begging for food, or simply
soliciting attention. The chief modern use of his tail appears to be to
express his ideas and sensations. But some recent experiments of Prof.
<span class = "smallcaps">A.&nbsp;Graham Bell</span>, no less eminent
from his work in artificial speech than in telephones, shows that
animals are more physically capable of pronouncing articulate sounds
than has been supposed. He informed the writer that he recently
succeeded by manipulation in causing an English terrier to form a number
of the sounds of our letters, and particularly brought out from it the
words “How are you, Grandmamma?” with distinctness. This tends to prove
that only absence of brain power has kept animals from acquiring true
speech. The remarkable vocal instrument of the parrot could be used in
significance as well as in imitation, if its brain had been developed
beyond the point of expression by gesture, in which latter the bird is
expert.</p>

<p>The gestures of monkeys, whose hands and arms can be used, are nearly
akin to ours. Insects communicate with each other almost entirely by
means of the antennæ. Animals in general which, though not deaf, can
<span class = "pagenum">276</span>
<a name = "page276" id = "page276"> </a>
not be taught by sound, frequently have been by signs, and probably all
of them understand man’s gestures better than his speech. They exhibit
signs to one another with obvious intention, and they also have often
invented them as a means of obtaining their wants from man.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_origin_children" id = "sign_origin_children">
GESTURES OF YOUNG CHILDREN.</a></h4>

<p>The wishes and emotions of very young children are conveyed in a
small number of sounds, but in a great variety of gestures and facial
expressions. A&nbsp;child’s gestures are intelligent long in advance of
speech; although very early and persistent attempts are made to give it
instruction in the latter but none in the former, from the time when it
begins <i>risu cognoscere matrem</i>. It learns words only as they are
taught, and learns them through the medium of signs which are not
expressly taught. Long after familiarity with speech, it consults the
gestures and facial expressions of its parents and nurses as if seeking
thus to translate or explain their words. These facts are important in
reference to the biologic law that the order of development of the
individual is the same as that of the species.</p>

<p>Among the instances of gestures common to children throughout the
world is that of protruding the lips, or pouting, when somewhat angry or
sulky. The same gesture is now made by the anthropoid apes and is found
strongly marked in the savage tribes of man. It is noticed by
evolutionists that animals retain during early youth, and subsequently
lose, characters once possessed by their progenitors when adult, and
still retained by distinct species nearly related to them.</p>

<p>The fact is not, however, to be ignored that children invent words as
well as signs with as natural an origin for the one as for the other. An
interesting case was furnished to the writer by Prof. <span class =
"smallcaps">Bell</span> of an infant boy who used a combination of
sounds given as “nyum-nyum,” an evident onomatope of gustation, to mean
“good,” and not only in reference to articles of food relished but as
applied to persons of whom the child was fond, rather in the abstract
idea of “niceness” in general. It is a singular coincidence that a
bright young girl, a&nbsp;friend of the writer, in a letter describing a
juvenile feast, invented the same expression, with nearly the same
spelling, as characteristic of her sensations regarding the delicacies
provided. The Papuans met by Dr. Comrie also called “eating”
<i>nam-nam</i>. But the evidence of all such cases of the voluntary use
of articulate speech by young children is qualified by the fact that it
has been inherited from very many generations, if not quite so long as
the faculty of gesture.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_origin_disorder" id = "sign_origin_disorder">
GESTURES IN MENTAL DISORDER.</a></h4>

<p>The insane understand and obey gestures when they have no knowledge
whatever of words. It is also found that semi-idiotic children who
cannot be taught more than the merest rudiments of speech, can receive a
considerable amount of information through signs, and can express
themselves by them. Sufferers from aphasia continue to use appropriate
<span class = "pagenum">277</span>
<a name = "page277" id = "page277"> </a>
gestures after their words have become uncontrollable. It is further
noticeable in them that mere ejaculations, or sounds which are only the
result of a state of feeling, instead of a desire to express thought,
are generally articulated with accuracy. Patients who have been in the
habit of swearing preserve their fluency in that division of their
vocabulary.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_origin_deafmute" id = "sign_origin_deafmute">
UNINSTRUCTED DEAF-MUTES.</a></h4>

<p>The signs made by congenital and uninstructed deaf-mutes to be now
considered are either strictly natural signs, invented by themselves, or
those of a colloquial character used by such mutes where associated. The
accidental or merely suggestive signs peculiar to families, one member
of which happens to be a mute, are too much affected by the other
members of the family to be of certain value. Those, again, which are
taught in institutions have become conventional and designedly adapted
to translation into oral speech, although founded by the abbé de l’Épée,
followed by the abbé Sicard, in the natural signs first above
mentioned.</p>

<p>A great change has doubtless occurred in the estimation of congenital
deaf-mutes since the Justinian Code, which consigned them forever to
legal infancy, as incapable of intelligence, and classed them with the
insane. Yet most modern writers, for instance Archbishop Whately and Max
Müller, have declared that deaf-mutes could not think until after having
been instructed. It cannot be denied that the deaf-mute thinks after his
instruction either in the ordinary gesture signs or in the finger
alphabet, or more lately in artificial speech. By this instruction he
has become master of a highly-developed language, such as English or
French, which he can read, write, and actually talk, but that foreign
language he has obtained through the medium of signs. This is a
conclusive proof that signs constitute a real language and one which
admits of thought, for no one can learn a foreign language unless he had
some language of his own, whether by descent or acquisition, by which it
could be translated, and such translation into the new language could
not even be commenced unless the mind had been already in action and
intelligently using the original language for that purpose. In fact the
use by deaf-mutes of signs originating in themselves exhibits a creative
action of mind and innate faculty of expression beyond that of ordinary
speakers who acquired language without conscious effort. The thanks of
students, both of philology and psychology, are due to Prof. <span class
= "smallcaps">Samuel Porter</span>, of the National Deaf Mute College,
for his response to the question, “Is thought possible without
language?” published in the <i>Princeton Review</i> for January,
1880.</p>

<p>With regard to the sounds uttered by deaf-mutes, the same explanation
of heredity may be made as above, regarding the words invented by young
children. Congenital deaf-mutes at first make the same sounds as hearing
children of the same age, and, often being susceptible to vibrations of
the air, are not suspected of being deaf. When that affliction is
ascertained to exist, all oral utterances from the deaf-mute are
habitually repressed by the parents.</p>

GESTURES OF THE BLIND.</a></h4>

<p>The facial expressions and gestures of the congenitally blind are
worthy of attention. The most interesting and conclusive examples come
from the case of Laura Bridgman, who, being also deaf, could not
possibly have derived them by imitation. When a letter from a beloved
friend was communicated to her by gesture-language, she laughed and
clapped her hands. A&nbsp;roguish expression was given to her face,
concomitant with the emotion, by her holding the lower lip by the teeth.
She blushed, shrugged her shoulders, turned in her elbows, and raised
her eye-brows under the same circumstances as other people. In
amazement, she rounded and protruded the lips, opened them, and breathed
strongly. It is remarkable that she constantly accompanied her “yes”
with the common affirmative nod, and her “no” with our negative shake of
the head, as these gestures are by no means universal and do not seem
clearly connected with emotion. This, possibly, may be explained by the
fact that her ancestors for many generations had used these gestures.
A&nbsp;similar curious instance is mentioned by Cardinal Wiseman
(<i>Essays</i>, III, 547, <i>London</i>, 1853) of an Italian blind man,
the appearance of whose eyes indicated that he had never enjoyed sight,
and who yet made the same elaborate gestures made by the people with
whom he lived, but which had been used by them immemorially, as
correctly as if he had learned them by observation.</p>

LOSS OF SPEECH BY ISOLATION.</a></h4>

<p>When human beings have been long in solitary confinement, been
abandoned, or otherwise have become isolated from their fellows, they
have lost speech either partially or entirely, and required to have it
renewed through gestures. There are also several recorded cases of
children, born with all their faculties, who, after having been lost or
abandoned, have been afterwards found to have grown up possessed of
acute hearing, but without anything like human speech. One of these was
Peter, “the Wild Boy,” who was found in the woods of Hanover in 1726,
and taken to England, where vain attempts were made to teach him
language, though he lived to the age of seventy. Another was a boy of
twelve, found in the forest of Aveyron, in France, about the beginning
of this century, who was destitute of speech, and all efforts to teach
him failed. Some of these cases are to be considered in connection with
the general law of evolution, that in degeneration the last and highest
acquirements are lost first. When in these the effort at acquiring or
re-acquiring speech has been successful, it has been through gestures,
in the same manner as missionaries, explorers, and shipwrecked mariners
have become acquainted with tongues before unknown to themselves and
sometimes to civilization. All persons in such circumstances are obliged
to proceed by pointing to objects and making gesticulations,
<span class = "pagenum">279</span>
<a name = "page279" id = "page279"> </a>
at the same time observing what articulate sounds were associated with
those motions by the persons addressed, and thus vocabularies and lists
of phrases were formed.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_origin_tribes" id = "sign_origin_tribes">
LOW TRIBES OF MAN.</a></h4>

<p>Apart from the establishment of a systematic language of signs under
special circumstances which have occasioned its development, the
gestures of the lower tribes of men may be generally classed under the
emotional or instinctive division, which can be correlated with those of
the lower animals. This may be illustrated by the modes adopted to show
friendship in salutation, taking the place of our shaking hands. Some
Pacific Islanders used to show their joy at meeting friends by sniffing
at them, after the style of well-disposed dogs. The Fuegians pat and
slap each other, and some Polynesians stroke their own faces with the
hand or foot of the friend. The practice of rubbing or pressing noses is
very common. It has been noticed in the Lapland Alps, often in Africa,
and in Australia the tips of the noses are pressed a long time,
accompanied with grunts of satisfaction. Patting and stroking different
parts of the body are still more frequent, and prevailed among the North
American Indians, though with the latter the most common expression was
hugging. In general, the civilities exchanged are similar to those of
many animals.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_origin_occasional" id = "sign_origin_occasional">
GESTURES AS AN OCCASIONAL RESOURCE.</a></h4>

<p>Persons of limited vocabulary, whether foreigners to the tongue
employed or native, but not accomplished in its use, even in the midst
of a civilization where gestures are deprecated, when at fault for words
resort instinctively to physical motions that are not wild nor
meaningless, but picturesque and significant, though perhaps made by the
gesturer for the first time. An uneducated laborer, if good-natured
enough to be really desirous of responding to a request for information,
when he has exhausted his scanty stock of words will eke them out by
original gestures. While fully admitting the advice to
Coriolanus&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant</p>
<p>More learned than the ears&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>it may be paraphrased to read that the hands of the ignorant are more
learned than their tongues. A&nbsp;stammerer, too, works his arms and
features as if determined to get his thoughts out, in a manner not only
suggestive of the physical struggle, but of the use of gestures as a
hereditary expedient.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_origin_fluent" id = "sign_origin_fluent">
GESTURES OF FLUENT TALKERS.</a></h4>

<p>The same is true of the most fluent talkers on occasions when the
exact vocal formula desired does not at once suggest itself, or is
unsatisfactory without assistance from the physical machinery not
embraced in the oral apparatus. The command of a copious vocabulary
common
<span class = "pagenum">280</span>
<a name = "page280" id = "page280"> </a>
to both speaker and hearer undoubtedly tends to a phlegmatic delivery
and disdain of subsidiary aid. An excited speaker will, however,
generally make a free use of his hands without regard to any effect of
that use upon auditors. Even among the gesture-hating English, when they
are aroused from torpidity of manner, the hands are involuntarily
clapped in approbation, rubbed with delight, wrung in distress, raised
in astonishment, and waved in triumph. The fingers are snapped for
contempt, the forefinger is vibrated to reprove or threaten, and the
fist shaken in defiance. The brow is contracted with displeasure, and
the eyes winked to show connivance. The shoulders are shrugged to
express disbelief or repugnance, the eyebrows elevated with surprise,
the lips bitten in vexation and thrust out in sullenness or displeasure,
while a higher degree of anger is shown by a stamp of the foot.
Quintilian, regarding the subject, however, not as involuntary
exhibition of feeling and intellect, but for illustration and
enforcement, becomes eloquent on the variety of motions of which the
hands alone are capable, as follows:</p>

<p>“The action of the other parts of the body assists the speaker, but
the hands (I&nbsp;could almost say) speak themselves. By them do we not
demand, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, supplicate, express abhorrence
and terror, question and deny? Do we not by them express joy and sorrow,
doubt, confession, repentance, measure, quantity, number, and time? Do
they not also encourage, supplicate, restrain, convict, admire, respect?
and in pointing out places and persons do they not discharge the office
of adverbs and of pronouns?”</p>

<p>Voss adopts almost the words of Quintilian, “<i>Manus non modo
loquentem adjuvant, sed ipsæ pene loqui videntur</i>,” while Cresollius
calls the hand “the minister of reason and wisdom <span class =
"ellipsis">***</span> without it there is no eloquence.”</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_origin_involuntary" id = "sign_origin_involuntary">
INVOLUNTARY RESPONSE TO GESTURES.</a></h4>

<p>Further evidence of the unconscious survival of gesture language is
afforded by the ready and involuntary response made in signs to signs
when a man with the speech and habits of civilization is brought into
close contact with Indians or deaf-mutes. Without having ever before
seen or made one of their signs, he will soon not only catch the meaning
of theirs, but produce his own, which they will likewise comprehend, the
power seemingly remaining latent in him until called forth by
necessity.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_origin_pantomime" id = "sign_origin_pantomime">
NATURAL PANTOMIME.</a></h4>

<p>In the earliest part of man’s history the subjects of his discourse
must have been almost wholly sensuous, and therefore readily expressed
in pantomime. Not only was pantomime sufficient for all the actual needs
of his existence, but it is not easy to imagine how he could have used
language such as is now known to us. If the best English dictionary and
grammar had been miraculously furnished to him, together with the art of
reading with proper pronunciation, the gift would have been valueless,
because the ideas expressed by the words had not yet been formed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">281</span>
<a name = "page281" id = "page281"> </a>
<p>That the early concepts were of a direct and material character is
shown by what has been ascertained of the roots of language, and there
does not appear to be much difficulty in expressing by other than vocal
instrumentality all that could have been expressed by those roots. Even
now, with our vastly increased belongings of external life, avocations,
and habits, nearly all that is absolutely necessary for our physical
needs can be expressed in pantomime. Far beyond the mere signs for
eating, drinking, sleeping, and the like, any one will understand a
skillful representation in signs of a tailor, shoemaker, blacksmith,
weaver, sailor, farmer, or doctor. So of washing, dressing, shaving,
walking, driving, writing, reading, churning, milking, boiling, roasting
or frying, making bread or preparing coffee, shooting, fishing, rowing,
sailing, sawing, planing, boring, and, in short, an endless list.</p>

<p>Max Müller properly calls touch, scent, and taste the palaioteric,
and sight and hearing the neoteric senses, the latter of which often
require to be verified by the former. Touch is the lowest in
specialization and development, and is considered to be the oldest of
the senses, the others indeed being held by some writers to be only its
modifications. Scent, of essential importance to many animals, has with
man almost ceased to be of any, except in connection with taste, which
he has developed to a high degree. Whether or not sight preceded hearing
in order of development, it is difficult, in conjecturing the first
attempts of man or his hypothetical ancestor at the expression either of
percepts or concepts, to connect vocal sounds with any large number of
objects, but it is readily conceivable that the characteristics of their
forms and movements should have been suggested to the eye&mdash;fully
exercised before the tongue&mdash;so soon as the arms and fingers became
free for the requisite simulation or portrayal. There is little
distinction between pantomime and a developed sign language, in which
thought is transmitted rapidly and certainly from hand to eye as it is
in oral speech from lips to ear; the former is, however, the parent of
the latter, which is more abbreviated and less obvious. Pantomime acts
movements, reproduces forms and positions, presents pictures, and
manifests emotions with greater realization than any other mode of
utterance. It may readily be supposed that a troglodyte man would desire
to communicate the finding of a cave in the vicinity of a pure pool,
circled with soft grass, and shaded by trees bearing edible fruit. No
sound of nature is connected with any of those objects, but the position
and size of the cave, its distance and direction, the water, its
quality, and amount, the verdant circling carpet, and the kind and
height of the trees could have been made known by pantomime in the days
of the mammoth, if articulate speech had not then been established, as
Indians or deaf-mutes now communicate similar information by the same
agency.</p>

<p>The proof of this fact, as regards deaf-mutes, will hardly be
demanded, as their expressive pantomime has been so often witnessed.
That of
<span class = "pagenum">282</span>
<a name = "page282" id = "page282"> </a>
the North American Indians, as distinct from the signs which are
generally its abbreviations, has been frequently described in general
terms, but it may be interesting to present two instances from remote
localities.</p>

<p>A Maricopa Indian, in the present limits of Arizona, was offered an
advantageous trade for his horse, whereupon he stretched himself on his
horse’s neck, caressed it tenderly, at the same time shutting his eyes,
meaning thereby that no offer could tempt him to part with his
charger.</p>

<p>An A-tco-mâ-wi or Pit River Indian, in Northeastern California, to
explain the cause of his cheeks and forehead being covered with tar,
represented a man falling, and, despite his efforts to save him,
trembling, growing pale (pointing from his face to that of a white man),
and sinking to sleep, his spirit winging its way to the skies, which he
indicated by imitating with his hands the flight of a bird upwards, his
body sleeping still upon the river bank, to which he pointed. The tar
upon his face was thus shown to be his dress of mourning for a friend
who had fallen and died.</p>

<p>Several descriptions of pure pantomime, intermixed with the more
conventionalized signs, will be found in the present paper. In especial,
reference is made to the Address of Kin Chē-ĕss, Nátci’s Narrative, the
Dialogue between Alaskan Indians, and Na-wa-gi-jig’s Story.</p>

SOME THEORIES UPON PRIMITIVE LANGUAGE.</a></h3>

<p>Cresollius, writing in 1620, was strongly in favor of giving
precedence to gesture. He says, “Man, full of wisdom and divinity, could
have appeared nothing superior to a naked trunk or block had he not been
adorned with the hand as the interpreter and messenger of his thoughts.”
He quotes with approval the brother of St. Basil in declaring that had
men been formed without hands they would never have been endowed with an
articulate voice, and concludes: “Since, then, nature has furnished us
with two instruments for the purpose of bringing into light and
expressing the silent affections of the mind, language and the hand, it
has been the opinion of learned and intelligent men that the former
would be maimed and nearly useless without the latter; whereas the hand,
without the aid of language, has produced many and wonderful
effects.”</p>

<p>Rabelais, who incorporated into his satirical work much true learning
and philosophy, makes his hero announce the following opinion:</p>

<p>“Nothing less, quoth Pantagruel [Book iii, ch. xix], do I believe
than that it is a mere abusing of our understandings to give credit to
the words of those who say that there is any such thing as a natural
language. All speeches have had their primary origin from the arbitrary
institutions, accords, and agreements of nations in their respective
condescendments
<span class = "pagenum">283</span>
<a name = "page283" id = "page283"> </a>
to what should be noted and betokened by them. An articulate voice,
according to the dialecticians, hath naturally no signification at all;
for that the sense and meaning thereof did totally depend upon the good
will and pleasure of the first deviser and imposer of it.”</p>

<p>Max Müller, following Professor Heyse, of Berlin, published an
ingenious theory of primitive speech, to the effect that man had a
creative faculty giving to each conception, as it thrilled through his
brain for the first time, a&nbsp;special phonetic expression, which
faculty became extinct when its necessity ceased. This theory, which
makes each radical of language to be a phonetic type rung out from the
organism of the first man or men when struck by an idea, has been
happily named the “ding-dong” theory. It has been abandoned mainly
through the destructive criticisms of Prof. <span class =
"smallcaps">W.&nbsp;D. Whitney</span>, of Yale College. One lucid
explanation by the latter should be specially noted: “A&nbsp;word is a
combination of sounds which by a series of historical reasons has come
to be accepted and understood in a certain community as the sign of a
certain idea. As long as they so accept and understand it, it has
existence; when everyone ceases to use and understand it, it ceases to
exist.”</p>

<p>Several authors, among them Kaltschmidt, contend that there was but
one primitive language, which was purely onomatopœic, that is, imitative
of natural sounds. This has been stigmatized as the “bow-wow” theory,
but its advocates might derive an argument from the epithet itself, as
not only our children, but the natives of Papua, call the dog a
“bow-wow.” They have, however, gone too far in attempting to trace back
words in their shape as now existing to any natural sounds instead of
confining that work to the roots from which the words have sprung.</p>

<p>Another attempt has been made, represented by Professor Noiré, to
account for language by means of interjectional cries. This Max Müller
revengefully styled the “pooh-pooh” theory. In it is included the
rhythmical sounds which a body of men make seemingly by a common impulse
when engaged in a common work, such as the cries of sailors when hauling
on a rope or pulling an oar, or the yell of savages in an attack. It
also derives an argument from the impulse of life by which the child
shouts and the bird sings. There are, however, very few either words or
roots of words which can be proved to have that derivation.</p>

<p>Professor <span class = "smallcaps">Sayce</span>, in his late work,
<i>Introduction to the Science of Language</i>, <i>London</i>, 1880,
gives the origin of language in gestures, in onomatopœia, and to a
limited extent in interjectional cries. He concludes it to be the
ordinary theory of modern comparative philologists that all languages
are traced back to a certain number of abstract roots, each of which was
a sort of sentence in embryo, and while he does not admit this as
usually presented, he believes that there was a time in the history
<span class = "pagenum">284</span>
<a name = "page284" id = "page284"> </a>
of speech, when the articulate or semi-articulate sounds uttered by
primitive men were made the significant representations of thought by
the gestures with which they were accompanied. This statement is
specially gratifying to the present writer as he had advanced much the
same views in his first publication on the subject in the following
paragraph, now reproduced with greater confidence:</p>

<p>“From their own failures and discordancies, linguistic scholars have
recently decided that both the ‘bow-wow’ and the ‘ding-dong’ theories
are unsatisfactory; that the search for imitative, onomatopœic, and
directly expressive sounds to explain the origin of human speech has
been too exclusive, and that many primordial roots of language have been
founded in the involuntary sounds accompanying certain actions. As,
however, the action was the essential, and the consequent or concomitant
sound the accident, it would be expected that a representation or
feigned reproduction of the action would have been used to express the
idea before the sound associated with that action could have been
separated from it. The visual onomatopœia of gestures, which even yet
have been subjected to but slight artificial corruption, would therefore
serve as a key to the audible. It is also contended that in the pristine
days, when the sounds of the only words yet formed had close connection
with objects and the ideas directly derived from them, signs were as
much more copious for communication than speech, as the sight embraces
more and more distinct characteristics of objects than does the sense of
hearing.”</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_theories_conclusions" id =
"sign_theories_conclusions">
CONCLUSIONS.</a></h4>

<p>The preponderance of authority is in favor of the view that man, when
in the possession of all his faculties, did not choose between voice and
gesture, both being originally instinctive, as they both are now, and
never, with those faculties, was in a state where the one was used to
the absolute exclusion of the other. The long neglected work of
Dalgarno, published in 1661, is now admitted to show wisdom when he
says: “<i>non minus naturale fit homini communicare in </i>Figuris<i>
quam </i>Sonis<i>: quorum utrumque dico homini </i>naturale<i>.</i>”
With the voice man at first imitated the few sounds of nature, while
with gesture he exhibited actions, motions, positions, forms,
dimensions, directions, and distances, and their derivatives. It would
appear from this unequal division of capacity that oral speech remained
rudimentary long after gesture had become an art. With the concession of
all purely imitative sounds and of the spontaneous action of the vocal
organs under excitement, it is still true that the connection between
ideas and words generally depended upon a compact between the speaker
and hearer which presupposes the existence of a prior mode of
communication. That was probably by gesture, which, in the apposite
phrase of Professor <span class = "smallcaps">Sayce</span>, “like the
rope-bridges of the Himalayas or the Andes, formed the first rude means
of communication between man and man.” At the very least it may be
<span class = "pagenum">285</span>
<a name = "page285" id = "page285"> </a>
gladly accepted provisionally as a clue leading out of the labyrinth of
philologic confusion.</p>

<p>For the purpose of the present paper there is, however, no need of an
absolute decision upon the priority between communication of ideas by
bodily motion and by vocal articulation. It is enough to admit that the
connection between them was so early and intimate that gestures, in the
wide sense indicated of presenting ideas under physical forms, had a
direct formative effect upon many words; that they exhibit the earliest
condition of the human mind; are traced from the remotest antiquity
among all peoples possessing records; are generally prevalent in the
savage stage of social evolution; survive agreeably in the scenic
pantomime, and still adhere to the ordinary speech of civilized man by
motions of the face, hands, head, and body, often involuntary, often
purposely in illustration or for emphasis.</p>

<p>It may be unnecessary to explain that none of the signs to be
described, even those of present world-wide prevalence, are presented as
precisely those of primitive man. Signs as well as words, animals, and
plants have had their growth, development, and change, their births and
deaths, and their struggle for existence with survival of the fittest.
It is, however, thought probable from reasons hereinafter mentioned that
their radicals can be ascertained with more precision than those of
words.</p>


<h3><a name = "sign_history" id = "sign_history">
HISTORY OF GESTURE LANGUAGE.</a></h3>

<p>There is ample evidence of record, besides that derived from other
sources, that the systematic use of gesture speech was of great
antiquity. Livy so declares, and Quintilian specifies that the “<i>lex
gestus <span class = "ellipsis">***</span> ab illis temporibus heroicis
orta est</i>.” Plato classed its practice among civil virtues, and
Chrysippus gave it place among the proper education of freemen. Athenæus
tells that gestures were even reduced to distinct classification with
appropriate terminology. The class suited to comedy was called Cordax,
that to tragedy Eumelia, and that for satire Sicinnis, from the inventor
Sicinnus. Bathyllus from these formed a fourth class, adapted to
pantomime. This system appears to have been particularly applicable to
theatrical performances. Quintilian, later, gave most elaborate rules
for gestures in oratory, which are specially noticeable from the
importance attached to the manner of disposing the fingers. He
attributed to each particular disposition a significance or suitableness
which are not now obvious. Some of them are retained by modern orators,
but without the same, or indeed any, intentional meaning, and others are
wholly disused.</p>

<p>The value of these digital arrangements is, however, shown by their
use among the modern Italians, to whom they have directly descended.
<span class = "pagenum">286</span>
<a name = "page286" id = "page286"> </a>
From many illustrations of this fact the following is selected. Fig. 61
is copied from Austin’s <i>Chironomia</i> as his graphic execution of
the gesture described by Quintilian: “The fore finger of the right hand
joining the middle of its nail to the extremity of its own thumb, and
moderately extending the rest of the fingers, is graceful in
<i>approving</i>.” Fig. 62 is taken from De Jorio’s plates and
descriptions of the gestures among modern Neapolitans, with the same
idea of approbation&mdash;“good.” Both of these may be compared with
Fig. 63, a&nbsp;common sign among the North American Indians to express
affirmation and approbation. With the knowledge of these details it is
possible to believe the story of Macrobius that Cicero used to vie with
Roscius, the celebrated actor, as to which of them could express a
sentiment in the greater variety of ways, the one by gesture and the
other by speech, with the apparent result of victory to the actor who
was so satisfied with the superiority of his art that he wrote a book on
the subject.</p>

<p>Gestures were treated of with still more distinction as connected
with pantomimic dances and representations. Æschylus appears to have
brought theatrical gesture to a high degree of perfection, but Telestes,
a&nbsp;dancer employed by him, introduced the dumb show, a&nbsp;dance
without marked dancing steps, and subordinated to motions of the hands,
arms, and body, which is dramatic pantomime. He was so great an artist,
says Athenæus, that when he represented the <i>Seven before Thebes</i>
he rendered every circumstance manifest by his gestures alone. From
Greece, or rather from Egypt, the art was brought to Rome, and in the
reign of Augustus was the great delight of that Emperor and his friend
Mæcenas. Bathyllus, of Alexandria, was the first to introduce it to the
Roman public, but he had a dangerous rival in Pylades. The latter was
magnificent, pathetic, and affecting, while Bathyllus was gay and
sportive. All Rome was split into factions about their respective
merits. Athenæus speaks of a distinguished performer of his own time
(he&nbsp;died A.D. 194) named Memphis, whom he calls the “dancing
philosopher,” because he showed what the Pythagorean philosophy could do
by exhibiting in silence everything with stronger evidence than they
could who professed to teach the arts of language. In the reign of Nero,
a&nbsp;celebrated pantomimist who had heard that the cynic philosopher
Demetrius spoke of the art with contempt, prevailed upon him to witness
his performance, with the result that the cynic, more and more
astonished,
<span class = "pagenum">287</span>
<a name = "page287" id = "page287"> </a>
at last cried out aloud, “Man, I&nbsp;not only see, but I hear what you
do, for to me you appear to speak with your hands!”</p>

<p>Lucian, who narrates this in his work <i>De Saltatione</i>, gives
another tribute to the talent of, perhaps, the same performer.
A&nbsp;barbarian prince of Pontus (the story is told elsewhere of
Tyridates, King of Armenia), having come to Rome to do homage to the
Emperor Nero, and been taken to see the pantomimes, was asked on his
departure by the Emperor what present he would have as a mark of his
favor. The barbarian begged that he might have the principal
pantomimist, and upon being asked why he made such an odd request,
replied that he had many neighbors who spoke such various and discordant
languages that he found it difficult to obtain any interpreter who could
understand them or explain his commands; but if he had the dancer he
could by his assistance easily make himself intelligible to all.</p>

<p>While the general effect of these pantomimes is often mentioned,
there remain but few detailed descriptions of them. Apuleius, however,
in the tenth book of his <i>Metamorphosis</i> or “Golden Ass,” gives
sufficient details of the performance of the Judgment of Paris to show
that it strongly resembled the best form of ballet opera known in modern
times. These exhibitions were so greatly in favor that, according to
Ammianus Marcellinus, there were in Rome in the year 190 six thousand
persons devoted to the art, and that when a famine raged they were all
kept in the city, though besides all the strangers all the philosophers
were forced to leave. Their popularity continued until the sixth
century, and it is evident from a decree of Charlemagne that they were
not lost, or at least, had been revived in his time. Those of us who
have enjoyed the performance of the original Ravel troupe will admit
that the art still survives, though not with the magnificence or
perfection, especially with reference to serious subjects, which it
exhibited in the age of imperial Rome.</p>

<p>Early and prominent among the post-classic works upon gesture is that
of the venerable Bede (who flourished A.D. 672-735) <i>De Loquelâ per
Gestum Digitorum, sive de Indigitatione</i>. So much discussion had
indeed been carried on in reference to the use of signs for the
desideratum of a universal mode of communication, which also was
designed to be occult and mystic, that Rabelais, in the beginning of the
sixteenth century, who, however satirical, never spent his force upon
matters of little importance, devotes much attention to it. He makes his
English philosopher, Thaumast “The Wonderful” declare, “I&nbsp;will
dispute by signs only, without speaking, for the matters are so
abstruse, hard, and arduous, that words proceeding from the mouth of man
will never be sufficient for unfolding of them to my liking.”</p>

<p>The earliest contributions of practical value connected with the
subject were made by George Dalgarno, of Aberdeen, in two works, one
published in London, 1661, entitled <i>Ars Signorum, vulgo character
universalis et lingua philosophica</i>, and the other printed at Oxford,
<span class = "pagenum">288</span>
<a name = "page288" id = "page288"> </a>
1680, entitled, <i>Didascalocophus, or the Deaf and Dumb Man’s
Tutor</i>. He spent his life in obscurity, and his works, though he was
incidentally mentioned by Leibnitz under the name of “M.&nbsp;Dalgarus,”
passed into oblivion. Yet he undoubtedly was the precursor of Bishop
Wilkins in his <i>Essay toward a Real Character and a Philosophical
Language</i>, published in London, 1668, though indeed the first idea
was far older, it having been, as reported by Piso, the wish of Galen
that some way might be found out to represent things by such peculiar
signs and names as should express their natures. Dalgarno’s ideas
respecting the education of the dumb were also of the highest value, and
though they were too refined and enlightened to be appreciated at the
period when he wrote, they probably were used by Dr. Wallis if not by
Sicard. Some of his thoughts should be quoted: “As I think the eye to be
as docile as the ear; so neither see I any reason but the hand might be
made as tractable an organ as the tongue; and as soon brought to form,
if not fair, at least legible characters, as the tongue to imitate and
echo back articulate sounds.” A&nbsp;paragraph prophetic of the late
success in educating blind deaf-mutes is as follows: “The soul can exert
her powers by the ministry of any of the senses: and, therefore, when
she is deprived of her principal secretaries, the eye and the ear, then
she must be contented with the service of her lackeys and scullions, the
other senses; which are no less true and faithful to their mistress than
the eye and the ear; but not so quick for dispatch.”</p>

<p>In his division of the modes of “expressing the inward emotions by
outward and sensible signs” he relegates to physiology cases “when the
internal passions are expressed by such external signs as have a natural
connection, by way of cause and effect, with the passion they discover,
as laughing, weeping, frowning, &amp;c., and this way of interpretation
being common to the brute with man belongs to natural philosophy. And
because this goes not far enough to serve the rational soul, therefore,
man has invented Sematology.” This he divides into Pneumatology,
interpretation by sounds conveyed through the ear; Schematology, by
figures to the eye, and Haptology, by mutual contact, skin to skin.
Schematology is itself divided into Typology or Grammatology, and
Cheirology or Dactylology. The latter embraces “the transient motions of
the fingers, which of all other ways of interpretation comes nearest to
that of the tongue.”</p>

<p>As a phase in the practice of gestures in lieu of speech must be
mentioned the code of the Cistercian monks, who were vowed to silence
except in religious exercises. That they might literally observe their
vows they were obliged to invent a system of communication by signs,
a&nbsp;list of which is given by Leibnitz, but does not show much
ingenuity.</p>

<p>A curious description of the speech of the early inhabitants of the
world, given by Swedenborg in his <i>Arcana Cœlestia</i>, published
1749-1756, may be compared with the present exhibitions of deaf-mutes in
institutions for their instruction. He says it was not articulate like
the
<span class = "pagenum">289</span>
<a name = "page289" id = "page289"> </a>
vocal speech of our time, but was tacit, being produced not by external
respiration, but by internal. They were able to express their meaning by
slight motions of the lips and corresponding changes of the face.</p>

<p>Austin’s comprehensive work, <i>Chironomia, or a Treatise on
Rhetorical Delivery</i>, <i>London</i>, 1806, is a repertory of
information for all writers on gesture, who have not always given credit
to it, as well as on all branches of oratory. This has been freely used
by the present writer, as has also the volume by the canon Andrea de
Jorio, <i>La Mimica degli Antichi investigata nel Gestire
Napoletano</i>, <i>Napoli</i>, 1832. The canon’s chief object was to
interpret the gestures of the ancients as shown in their works of art
and described in their writings, by the modern gesticulations of the
Neapolitans, and he has proved that the general system of gesture once
prevailing in ancient Italy is substantially the same as now observed.
With an understanding of the existing language of gesture the scenes on
the most ancient Greek vases and reliefs obtain a new and interesting
significance and form a connecting link between the present and
prehistoric times. Two of De Jorio’s plates are here reproduced, Figs.
64 and 67, with such explanation and further illustration as is required
for the present subject.</p>

<p>The spirited figures upon the ancient vase, Fig. 64, are red upon a
black ground and are described in the published account in French of the
collection of Sir John Coghill, Bart., of which the following is a free
translation:</p>

<p>Dionysos or Bacchus is represented with a strong beard, his head girt
with the credemnon, clothed in a long folded tunic, above which is an
ample cloak, and holding a thyrsus. Under the form of a satyr, Comus, or
the genius of the table, plays on the double flute and tries to excite
to the dance two nymphs, the companions of Bacchus&mdash;Galené,
Tranquility, and Eudia, Serenity. The first of them is dressed in a
tunic, above which is a fawn skin, holding a tympanum or classic drum on
which she is about to strike, while her companion marks the time by a
snapping of the fingers, which custom the author of the catalogue wisely
states is still kept up in Italy in the dance of the tarantella. The
composition is said to express allegorically that pure and serene
pleasures are benefits derived from the god of wine.</p>

</div>

<p>This is a fair example of the critical acumen of art-commentators.
The gestures of the two nymphs are interesting, but on very slight
examination it appears that those of Galené have nothing to do with beat
of drum, nor have those of Eudia any connection with music, though it is
not so clear what is the true subject under discussion. Aided, however,
by the light of the modern sign language of Naples, there seems to be by
no means serenity prevailing, but a quarrel between the ladies, on a
special subject which is not necessarily pure. The nymph at the reader’s
left fixes her eyes upon her companion with her index in the same
direction, clearly indicating, <i>thou</i>. That the address is
reproachful is shown from her countenance, but with greater certainty
from her attitude and the corresponding one of her companion, who raises
<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
<a name = "page290" id = "page290"> </a>
both her hands in surprise accompanied with negation. The latter is
expressed by the right hand raised toward the shoulder, with the palm
opposed to the person to whom response is made. This is the rejection of
the idea presented, and is expressed by some of our Indians, as shown in
Fig. 65. A&nbsp;sign of the Dakota tribe of Indians with the same
signification is given in <a href = "#fig270">Fig. 270</a>, page 441,
<i>infra</i>. At the same time the upper part of the nymph’s body is
drawn backward as far as the preservation of equilibrium permits. So a
reproach or accusation is made on the one part, and denied, whether
truthfully or not, on the other. Its subject also may be ascertained.
The left hand of Eudia is not mute; it is held towards her rival with
the balls of the index and thumb united, the modern Neapolitan sign for
<i>love</i>, which is drawn more clearly in Fig. 66. It is called the
kissing of the thumb and finger, and there is ample authority to show
that among the ancient classics it was a sign of marriage. St. Jerome,
quoted by Vincenzo Requena, says: “<i>Nam et ipsa digitorum conjunctio,
et quasi molli osculo se complectans et fœderans, maritum pingit et
conjugem</i>;” and Apuleius clearly alludes to the same gesture as used
in the adoration of Venus, by the words “<i>primore digito in erectum
pollicem residente</i>.” The gesture is one of the few out of the large
number described in various parts of Rabelais’ great work, the
significance of which is explained. It is made by Naz-de-cabre or Goat’s
Nose (<i>Pantagruel</i>, Book III, Ch.&nbsp;XX), who lifted up into the
air his left hand, the whole fingers whereof he retained fistways closed
together, except the thumb and the forefinger, whose nails he softly
joined and coupled to one another. “I&nbsp;understand, quoth Pantagruel,
what he meaneth by that sign. It denotes marriage.” The quarrel is thus
established to be about love; and the fluting satyr seated between the
two nymphs, behind whose back the accusation is furtively made by the
jealous one, may well be the object concerning whom jealousy is
manifested. Eudia therefore, instead of “serenely” marking time for a
“tranquil” tympanist, appears to be crying, “Galené! you bad thing! you
are having, or trying to have, an affair with my Comus!”&mdash;an
accusation which this writer verily believes to have been just. The
lady’s attitude in affectation of surprised denial is not that of
injured innocence.</p>

<p>Fig. 67, taken from a vase in the Homeric Gallery, is rich in natural
gestures. Without them, from the costumes and attitudes it is easy to
recognize the protagonist or principal actor in the group, and its
general subject. The warrior goddess Athené stands forth in the midst of
what appears to be a council of war. After the study of modern gesture
<span class = "pagenum">291</span>
<a name = "page291" id = "page291"> </a>
speech, the votes of each member of the council, with the degree of
positiveness or interest felt by each, can be ascertained. Athené in
animated motion turns her eyes to the right, and extends her left arm
and hand to the left, with her right hand brandishing a lance in the
same direction, in which her feet show her to be ready to spring. She is
urging the figures on her right to follow her at once to attempt some
dangerous enterprise. Of these the elderly man, who is calmly seated,
holds his right hand flat and reversed, and suspended slightly above his
knee. This probably is the ending of the modern Neapolitan gesture, Fig.
68, which signifies hesitation, advice to pause before hasty action, “go
slowly,” and commences higher with a gentle wavering movement downward.
This can be compared with the sign of some of our Indians, Fig. 69, for
<i>wait!</i> <i>slowly!</i> The female figure at the left of the group,
standing firmly and decidedly, raises her left hand directed to the
goddess with the palm vertical. If this is supposed to be a stationary
gesture it means, “<i>wait!</i> <i>stop!</i>” It may, however, be the
commencement of the last mentioned gesture, “<i>go slow</i>.”</p>

<p>Both of these members of the council advise delay and express doubt
of the propriety of immediate action.</p>

</div>

<p>The sitting warrior on the left of Athené presents his left hand flat
and carried well up. This position, supposed to be stationary, now means
to <i>ask, inquire</i>, and it may be that he inquires of the other
veteran what reasons he can produce for his temporizing policy. This may
be collated with the modern Neapolitan sign for <i>ask</i>, Fig. 70, and
the common Indian sign for “<i>tell me!</i>” Fig. 71. In connection with
this it is also interesting to compare the Australian sign for
interrogation, Fig. 72, and also the Comanche Indian sign for <i>give
me</i>, <a href = "#fig301">Fig. 301</a>, page 480, <i>infra</i>. If,
however, the artist had the intention to represent the flat hand as in
motion from below upward, as is probable from the connection, the
meaning is <i>much, greatly</i>. He strongly disapproves the counsel of
the opposite side. Our Indians often express the idea of quantity,
<i>much</i>, with the same conception of comparative height, by an
upward motion of the extended palm, but with them the palm is held
downward. The last figure to the right, by the action of his whole body,
shows his rejection
<span class = "pagenum">292</span>
<a name = "page292" id = "page292"> </a>
of the proposed delay, and his right hand gives the modern sign of
combined surprise and reproof.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the similarity of the merely emotional
gestures and attitudes of modern Italy with those of the classics. The
Pulcinella, Fig. 73, for instance, drawn from life in the streets of
Naples, has the same pliancy and <i>abandon</i> of the limbs as appears
in the supposed foolish slaves of the Vatican Terence.</p>

Fig. 74.</p>
</div>

<p>In close connection with this branch of the study reference must be
made to the gestures exhibited in the works of Italian art only modern
in comparison with the high antiquity of their predecessors. A&nbsp;good
instance is in the Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci, painted toward the
close of the fifteenth century, and to the figure of Judas as there
portrayed. The gospel denounces him as a thief, which is expressed in
the painting by the hand extended and slightly curved; imitative of the
pilferer’s act in clutching and drawing toward him furtively the stolen
object, and is the same gesture that now indicates <i>theft</i> in
Naples, Fig. 74, and among some of the North American Indians, Fig. 75.
The pictorial propriety of the sign is preserved by the apparent desire
of the traitor to obtain the one white loaf of bread on the table (the
remainder being of coarser quality) which lies near where his hand is
tending. Raffaelle was equally particular in his exhibition of gesture
language, even unto the minutest detail of the arrangement of the
fingers. It is traditional that he sketched the Madonna’s hands for the
Spasimo di Sicilia in eleven different positions before he was
satisfied.</p>

<p>No allusion to the bibliography of gesture speech, however slight,
should close without including the works of Mgr. D.&nbsp;De Haerne, who
has, as a member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, in addition
to his rank in the Roman Catholic Church, been active in promoting the
cause of education in general, and especially that of the deaf and dumb.
His admirable treatise <i>The Natural Language of Signs</i> has been
translated and is accessible to American
<span class = "pagenum">293</span>
<a name = "page293" id = "page293"> </a>
readers in the <i>American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb</i>, 1875. In
that valuable serial, conducted by Prof. <span class =
"smallcaps">E.&nbsp;A. Fay</span>, of the National Deaf Mute College at
Washington, and now in its twenty-sixth volume, a&nbsp;large amount of
the current literature on the subject indicated by its title can be
found.</p>


<h3><a name = "sign_modern" id = "sign_modern">
MODERN USE OF GESTURE SPEECH.</a></h3>

<p>Dr. <span class = "smallcaps">Tylor</span> says (<i>Early History of
Mankind</i>, 44): “We cannot lay down as a rule that gesticulation
decreases as civilization advances, and say, for instance, that a
Southern Frenchman, because his talk is illustrated with gestures as a
book with pictures, is less civilized than a German or Englishman.” This
is true, and yet it is almost impossible for persons not accustomed to
gestures to observe them without associating the idea of low culture.
Thus in Mr. Darwin’s summing up of those characteristics of the natives
of Tierra del Fuego, which rendered it difficult to believe them to be
fellow-creatures, he classes their “violent gestures” with their filthy
and greasy skins, discordant voices, and hideous faces bedaubed with
paint. This description is quoted by the Duke of Argyle in his <i>Unity
of Nature</i> in approval of those characteristics as evidence, of the
lowest condition of humanity.</p>

<p>Whether or not the power of the visible gesture relative to, and its
influence upon the words of modern oral speech are in inverse proportion
to the general culture, it seems established that they do not bear that
or any constant proportion to the development of the several languages
with which gesture is still more or less associated. The statement has
frequently been made that gesture is yet to some highly-advanced
languages a necessary modifying factor, and that only when a language
has become so artificial as to be completely expressible in written
signs&mdash;indeed, has been remodeled through their long familiar
use&mdash;can the bodily signs be wholly dispensed with. The evidence
for this statement is now doubted, and it is safer to affirm that a
common use of gesture depends more upon the sociologic conditions of the
speakers than upon the degree of copiousness of their oral speech.</p>

USE BY OTHER PEOPLES THAN NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.</a></h4>

<p>The nearest approach to a general rule which it is now proposed to
hazard is that where people speaking precisely the same dialect are not
numerous, and are thrown into constant contact on equal terms with
others of differing dialects and languages, gesture is necessarily
resorted to for converse with the latter, and remains for an indefinite
time as a habit or accomplishment among themselves, while large bodies
enjoying common speech, and either isolated from foreigners, or, when in
contact with them, so dominant as to compel the learning and adoption of
their own tongue, become impassive in its delivery. The ungesturing
English, long insular, and now rulers when spread over continents, may
be compared with the profusely gesticulating Italians dwelling in a maze
of dialects and subject for centuries either to foreign rule or to the
influx of strangers on whom they depended. So common is the use of
gestures in Italy, especially among the lower and uneducated classes,
that utterance without them seems to be nearly impossible. The driver or
boatman will often, on being addressed, involuntarily drop the reins or
oars, at the risk of a serious accident, to respond with his arms and
fingers in accompaniment of his tongue. Nor is the habit confined to the
uneducated. King Ferdinand returning to Naples after the revolt of 1821,
and finding that the boisterous multitude would not allow his voice to
be heard, resorted successfully to a royal address in signs, giving
reproaches, threats, admonitions, pardon, and dismissal, to the entire
satisfaction of the assembled lazzaroni. The medium, though probably not
the precise manner of its employment, recalls Lucan’s account of the
quieting of an older tumult&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "deep">tumultum</p>
<p>Composuit vultu, dextraque silentia fecit.</p>
</div>

<p>This rivalry of Punch would, in London, have occasioned measureless
ridicule and disgust. The difference in what is vaguely styled
temperament does not wholly explain the contrast between the two
peoples, for the performance was creditable both to the readiness of the
King in an emergency and to the aptness of his people, the main
distinction being that in Italy there was in 1821, and still is,
a&nbsp;recognized and cultivated language of signs long disused in Great
Britain. In seeking to account for this it will be remembered that the
Italians have a more direct descent from the people who, as has been
above shown, in classic times so long and lovingly cultivated gesture as
a system. They have also had more generally before their eyes the
artistic relics in which gestures have been preserved.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that some English writers, notably Addison
(<i>Spectator</i>, 407), have contended that it does not suit the genius
of that nation to use gestures even in public speaking, against which
doctrine Austin vigorously remonstrates. He says: “There may possibly be
nations whose livelier feelings incline them more to gesticulation than
is common among us, as there are also countries in which plants of
excellent use
<span class = "pagenum">295</span>
<a name = "page295" id = "page295"> </a>
to man grow spontaneously; these, by care and culture, are found to
thrive also in colder countries.”</p>

<p>It is in general to be remarked that as the number of dialects in any
district decreases so will the gestures, though doubtless there is also
weight in the fact not merely that a language has been reduced to and
modified by writing, but that people who are accustomed generally to
read and write, as are the English and Germans, will after a time think
and talk as they write, and without the accompaniments still persistent
among Hindus, Arabs, and the less literate of European nations.</p>

<p>The fact that in the comparatively small island of Sicily gesture
language has been maintained until the present time in a perfection not
observed elsewhere in Europe must be considered in connection with the
above remark on England’s insularity, and it must also be admitted that
several languages have prevailed in the latter, still leaving dialects.
This apparent similarity of conditions renders the contrast as regards
use of gestures more remarkable, yet there are some reasons for their
persistence in Sicily which apply with greater force than to Great
Britain. The explanation, through mere tradition, is that the common
usage of signs dates from the time of Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse,
who prohibited meetings and conversation among his subjects, under the
direst penalties, so that they adopted that expedient to hold
communication. It would be more useful to consider the peculiar history
of the island. The Sicanians being its aborigines it was colonized by
Greeks, who, as the Romans asserted, were still more apt at gesture than
themselves. This colonization was also by separate bands of adventurers
from several different states of Greece, so that they started with
dialects and did not unite in a common or national organization, the
separate cities and their territories being governed by oligarchies or
tyrants frequently at war with each other, until, in the fifth century
B.C., the Carthaginians began to contribute a new admixture of language
and blood, followed by Roman, Vandal, Gothic, Herulian, Arab, and Norman
subjugation. Thus some of the conditions above suggested have existed in
this case, but, whatever the explanation, the accounts given by
travelers of the extent to which the language of signs has been used
even during the present generation are so marvelous as to deserve
quotation. The one selected is from the pen of Alexandre Dumas, who, it
is to be hoped, did not carry his genius for romance into a professedly
sober account of travel:</p>

<p>“In the intervals of the acts of the opera I saw lively conversations
carried on between the orchestra and the boxes. Arami, in particular,
recognized a friend whom he had not seen for three years, and who
related to him, by means of his eyes and his hands, what, to judge by
the eager gestures of my companion, must have been matters of great
interest. The conversation ended, I&nbsp;asked him if I might know
without impropriety what was the intelligence which had seemed to
interest him so deeply. ‘O,&nbsp;yes,’ he replied, ‘that person is one
of my good friends, who has been away from Palermo for three years, and
he has been telling me that he was married at Naples; then traveled with
his wife in
<span class = "pagenum">296</span>
<a name = "page296" id = "page296"> </a>
Austria and in France; there his wife gave birth to a daughter, whom he
had the misfortune to lose; he arrived by steamboat yesterday, but his
wife had suffered so much from sea-sickness that she kept her bed, and
he came alone to the play.’ ‘My dear friend,’ said I to Arami, ‘if you
would have me believe you, you must grant me a favor.’ ‘What is it?’
said he. ‘It is, that you do not leave me during the evening, so that I
may be sure you give no instructions to your friend, and when we join
him, that you ask him to repeat aloud what he said to you by signs.’
‘That I will,’ said Arami. The curtain then rose; the second act of
Norma was played; the curtain falling, and the actors being recalled, as
usual, we went to the side-room, where we met the traveler. ‘My dear
friend,’ said Arami, ‘I&nbsp;did not perfectly comprehend what you
wanted to tell me; be so good as to repeat it.’ The traveler repeated
the story word for word, and without varying a syllable from the
translation, which Arami had made of his signs; it was marvelous
indeed.</p>

<p>“Six weeks after this, I saw a second example of this faculty of mute
communication. This was at Naples. I&nbsp;was walking with a young man
of Syracuse. We passed by a sentinel. The soldier and my companion
exchanged two or three grimaces, which at another time I should not even
have noticed, but the instances I had before seen led me to give
attention. ‘Poor fellow,’ sighed my companion. ‘What did he say to you?’
I&nbsp;asked. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘I&nbsp;thought that I recognized him as
a Sicilian, and I learned from him, as we passed, from what place he
came; he said he was from Syracuse, and that he knew me well. Then I
asked him how he liked the Neapolitan service; he said he did not like
it at all, and if his officers did not treat him better he should
certainly finish by deserting. I&nbsp;then signified to him that if he
ever should be reduced to that extremity, he might rely upon me, and
that I would aid him all in my power. The poor fellow thanked me with
all his heart, and I have no doubt that one day or other I shall see him
come.’ Three days after, I&nbsp;was at the quarters of my Syracusan
friend, when he was told that a man asked to see him who would not give
his name; he went out and left me nearly ten minutes. ‘Well,’ said he,
on returning, ‘just as I said.’ ‘What?’ said&nbsp;I. ‘That the poor
fellow would desert.’”</p>

<p>After this there is an excuse for believing the tradition that the
revolt called “the Sicilian Vespers,” in 1282, was arranged throughout
the island without the use of a syllable, and even the day and hour for
the massacre of the obnoxious foreigners fixed upon by signs only.
Indeed, the popular story goes so far as to assert that all this was
done by facial expression, without even manual signs.</p>

<h5>NEAPOLITAN SIGNS.</h5>

<p>It is fortunately possible to produce some illustrations of the
modern Neapolitan sign language traced from the plates of De Jorio, with
translations, somewhat condensed, of his descriptions and remarks.</p>

Fig. 77.</p>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 76 an ambulant secretary or public writer is seated at his
<span class = "pagenum">297</span>
<a name = "page297" id = "page297"> </a>
little table, on which are the meager tools of his trade. He wears
spectacles in token that he has read and written much, and has one seat
at his side to accommodate his customers. On this is seated a married
woman who asks him to write a letter to her absent husband. The
secretary, not being told what to write about, without surprise, but
somewhat amused, raises his left hand with the ends of the thumb and
finger joined, the other fingers naturally open, a&nbsp;common sign for
<i>inquiry</i>. “What shall the letter be about?” The wife, not being
ready of speech, to rid herself of the embarrassment, resorts to the
mimic art, and, without opening her mouth, tells with simple gestures
all that is in her mind. Bringing her right hand to her heart, with a
corresponding glance of the eyes she shows that the theme is to be
<i>love</i>. For emphasis also she curves the whole upper part of her
body towards him, to exhibit the intensity of her passion. To complete
the mimic story, she makes with her left hand the sign of <i>asking</i>
for something, which has been above described (see page 291). The
letter, then, is to assure her husband of her love and to beg him to
return it with corresponding affection. The other woman, perhaps her
sister, who has understood the whole direction, regards the request as
silly and fruitless and is much disgusted. Being on her feet, she takes
a step toward the wife, who she thinks is unadvised, and raises her left
hand with a sign of disapprobation. This position of the hand is
described in full as open, raised high, and oscillated from right to
left. Several of the Indian signs have the same idea of oscillation of
the hand raised, often near the head, to express <i>folly, fool</i>. She
clearly says, “What a thing to ask! what a fool you are!” and at the
same time makes with the right hand the sign of <i>money</i>. This is
made by the extremities of the thumb and index rapidly rubbed against
each other, and is shown more clearly in Fig. 77. It is taken from the
handling and counting of coin. This may be compared with an Indian sign,
see <a href = "#fig115">Fig. 115</a>, page 344.</p>

<p>So the sister is clearly disapproving with her left hand and with her
right giving good counsel, as if to say, in the combination, “What a
fool you are to ask for his love; you had better ask him to send you
some money.”</p>

<p>In Naples, as in American cities, boiled ears of green corn are
vended with much outcry. Fig. 78 shows a boy who is attracted by the
local cry “<i>Pollanchelle tenerelle!</i>” and seeing the sweet golden
ears still boiling in the kettle from which steams forth fragrance, has
an ardent desire to taste the same, but is without a <i>soldo</i>. He
tries begging. His right open hand is advanced toward the desired object
with the sign of <i>asking</i> or <i>begging</i>, and he also raises his
left forefinger to indicate the number <i>one</i>&mdash;“Pretty girl,
please only give me one!” The pretty girl is by no means cajoled, and
while her left hand holds the ladle ready to use if he
<span class = "pagenum">298</span>
<a name = "page298" id = "page298"> </a>
dares to touch her merchandise, she replies by gesture “<i>Te voglio dà
no cuorno!</i>” freely translated, “I’ll give you one <i>in a horn!</i>”
This gesture is drawn, with clearer outline in Fig. 79, and has many
significations, according to the subject-matter and context, and also as
applied to different parts of the body. Applied to the head it has
allusion, descending from high antiquity, to a marital misfortune which
was probably common in prehistoric times as well as the present. It is
also often used as an amulet against the <i>jettatura</i> or evil eye,
and misfortune in general, and directed toward another person is a
prayerful wish for his or her preservation from evil. This use is
ancient, as is shown on medals and statues, and is supposed by some to
refer to the horns of animals slaughtered in sacrifice. The position of
the fingers, Fig. 80, is also given as one of Quintilian’s oratorical
gestures by the words “<i>Duo quoque medii sub pollicem veniunt</i>,”
and is said by him to be vehement and connected with reproach or
argument. In the present case, as a response to an impertinent or
disagreeable petition, it simply means, “instead of giving what you ask,
I&nbsp;will give you nothing but what is vile and useless, as horns
are.”</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 81.</span>&mdash;Disturbance at signing
of Neapolitan marriage contract.</p>

<p>Fig. 81 tells a story which is substantially the foundation of the
slender plot of most modern scenic pantomimes preliminary to the
bursting forth from their chrysalides of Harlequin, Columbine,
Pantaloon, and company. A&nbsp;young girl, with the consent of her
parents, has for some time promised her hand to an honest youth. The old
mother, in despite of her word, has taken a caprice to give her daughter
to another suitor. The father, though much under the sway of his spouse,
is in his heart desirous to keep his engagement, and has called in the
notary to draw the contract. At this moment the scene begins, the actors
of which, for greater perspicuity and brevity, may be provided with
stage names as follows:</p>

<div class = "list">
<p>Cecca, diminutive for Francisca, the mother of&mdash;</p>
<p>Nanella, diminutive of Antoniella, the betrothed of&mdash;</p>
<p>Peppino, diminutive of Peppe, which is diminutive of <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘Guiseppe’">Giuseppe</ins>.</p>
<p>Pasquale, husband of Cecca and father of Nanella.</p>
<p>Tonno, diminutive of Antonio, favored by Cecca.</p>

alt = "see text"></p>

<p class = "caption smallcaps">
Fig. 82.</p>
</div>

<p>Cecca tries to pick a quarrel with Peppino, and declares that the
contract shall not be signed. He reminds her of her promise, and accuses
her of breach of faith. In her passion she calls on her daughter to
repudiate her lover, and casting her arms around her, commands her to
make the sign of breaking off
friendship&mdash;“<i>scocchiare</i>”&mdash;which she has herself made to
Peppino, and which consists in extending the hand
<span class = "pagenum">299</span>
<a name = "page299" id = "page299"> </a>
with the joined ends of finger and thumb before described, see <a href =
"#fig66">Fig. 66</a>, and then separating them, thus breaking the union.
This the latter reluctantly pretends to do with one hand, yet with the
other, which is concealed from her irate mother’s sight, shows her
constancy by continuing with emphatic pressure the sign of <i>love</i>.
According to the gesture vocabulary, on the sign <i>scocchiare</i> being
made to a person who is willing to accept the breach of former
affection, he replies in the same manner, or still more forcibly by
inserting the index of the other hand between the index and thumb of the
first, thus showing the separation by the presence of a material
obstacle. Simply refraining from holding out the hand in any responsive
gesture is sufficient to indicate that the breach is not accepted, but
that the party addressed desires to continue in friendship instead of
resolving into enmity. This weak and inactive negative, however, does
not suit Peppino’s vivacity, who, placing his left hand on his bosom,
makes, with his right, one of the signs for emphatic negation. This
consists of the palm turned to the person addressed with the index
somewhat extended and separated from the other fingers, the whole hand
being oscillated from right to left. This gesture appears on ancient
Greek vases, and is compound, the index being demonstrative and the
negation shown by the horizontal oscillation, the whole being
translatable as, “That thing I want not, won’t have, reject.” The sign
is virtually the same as that made by Arapaho and Cheyenne Indians (see
<span class = "smallcaps">Extracts from Dictionary</span>, page 440,
<i>infra</i>). The conception of oscillation to show negation also
appears with different execution in the sign of the Jicarilla Apaches
and the Pai-Utes, Fig. 82. The same sign is reported from Japan, in the
same sense.</p>

<p>Tonno, in hopes that the quarrel is definitive, to do his part in
stopping the ceremony, proceeds to blow out the three lighted candles,
which are an important traditional feature of the rite. The good old man
Pasquale, with his hands extended, raised in surprised displeasure and
directed toward the insolent youth, stops his attempt. The veteran
notary, familiar with such quarrels in his experience, smiles at this
one, and, continuing in his quiet attitude, extends his right hand
placidly to Peppino with the sign of <i>adagio</i>, before described,
see <a href = "#fig68">Fig. 68</a>, advising him not to get excited, but
to persist quietly, and all would be well.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 83.</span>&mdash;Coming home of
Neapolitan bride.</p>

<p>Fig. 83 portrays the first entrance of a bride to her husband’s
house. She comes in with a tender and languid mien, her pendent arms
indicating soft yielding, and the right hand loosely holds a
handkerchief, ready to apply in case of overpowering emotion. She is, or
feigns to be, so timid and embarrassed as to require support by the arm
of a friend who introduces her. She is followed by a male friend of the
family, whose joyful face is turned toward supposed by-standers, right
hand pointing to the new acquisition, while with his left he makes the
sign of horns before described, see <a href = "#fig79">Fig. 79</a>,
which in this connection is to wish prosperity
<span class = "pagenum">300</span>

and avert misfortune, and is equivalent to the words in the Neapolitan
dialect, “<i>Mal’uocchie non nce pozzano</i>”&mdash;may evil eyes never
have power over her.</p>

<p>The female confidant, who supports and guides her embarrassed friend
with her right arm, brings her left hand into the sign of
<i>beautiful</i>&mdash;“See what a beauty she is!” This sign is made by
the thumb and index open and severally lightly touching each side of the
lower cheek, the other fingers open. It is given on a larger scale and
slightly varied in Fig. 84, evidently referring to a fat and rounded
visage. Almost the same sign is made by the Ojibwas of Lake Superior,
and a mere variant of it is made by the Dakotas&mdash;stroking the
cheeks alternately down to the tip of the chin with the palm or surface
of the extended fingers.</p>

<p class = "caption smallcaps">
Fig. 85.</p>
</div>

<p>The mother-in-law greets the bride by making the sign <i>mano in
fica</i> with her right hand. This sign, made with the hand clenched and
the point of the thumb between and projecting beyond the fore and middle
fingers, is more distinctly shown in Fig. 85. It has a very ancient
origin, being found on Greek antiques that have escaped the destruction
of time, more particularly in bronzes, and undoubtedly refers to the
<i>pudendum muliebre</i>. It is used offensively and ironically, but
also&mdash;which is doubtless the case in this instance&mdash;as an
invocation or prayer against evil, being more forcible than the
horn-shaped gesture before described. With this sign the Indian sign for
<i>female</i>, see <a href = "#fig132">Fig. 132</a>, page 357,
<i>infra</i>, may be compared.</p>

<p>The mother-in-law also places her left hand hollowed in front of her
abdomen, drawing with it her gown slightly forward, thereby making a
pantomimic representation of the state in which “women wish to be who
love their lords”; the idea being plainly an expressed hope that the
household will be blessed with a new generation.</p>

<p>Next to her is a hunchback, who is present as a familiar clown or
merrymaker, and dances and laughs to please the company, at the same
time snapping his fingers. Two other illustrations of this action, the
middle finger in one leaving and in the other having left the thumb and
passed to its base, are seen in Figs. 86, 87. This gesture by itself
has, like others mentioned, a&nbsp;great variety of significations, but
here means <i>joy</i> and acclamation. It is frequently used among us
for subdued applause, less violent than clapping the two hands, but
still oftener to express negation with disdain, and also carelessness.
Both these uses of it are common in Naples, and appear in Etruscan vases
and
<span class = "pagenum">301</span>
<a name = "page301" id = "page301"> </a>
Pompeian paintings, as well as in the classic authors. The significance
of the action in the hand of the contemporary statue of Sardanapalus at
Anchiale is clearly <i>worthlessness</i>, as shown by the inscription in
Assyrian, “Sardanapalus, the son of Anacyndaraxes, built in one day
Anchiale and Tarsus. Eat, drink, play; the rest is not worth
<i>that!</i>”</p>

<p>The bridegroom has left his mother to do the honors to the bride, and
himself attends to the rest of the company, inviting one of them to
drink some wine by a sign, enlarged in Fig. 88, which is not merely
pointing to the mouth with the thumb, but the hand with the incurved
fingers represents the body of the common glass flask which the
Neapolitans use, the extended thumb being its neck; the invitation is
therefore specially to drink wine. The guest, however, responds by a
very obvious gesture that he don’t wish anything to drink, but he would
like to eat some macaroni, the fingers being disposed as if handling
that comestible in the fashion of vulgar Italians. If the idea were only
to eat generally, it would have been expressed by the fingers and thumb
united in a point and moved several times near and toward the mouth, not
raised above it, as is necessary for suspending the strings of
macaroni.</p>

<p>In Fig. 89 the female in the left of the group is much disgusted at
seeing one of her former acquaintances, who has met with good fortune,
promenade in a fine costume with her husband. Overcome with jealousy,
she spreads out her dress derisively on both sides, in imitation of the
hoop-skirts once worn by women of rank, as if to say “So you are playing
the great lady!” The insulted woman, in resentment, makes with both
hands, for double effect, the sign of horns, before described, which in
this case is done obviously in menace and imprecation. The husband is a
pacific fellow who is not willing to get into a woman’s quarrel, and is
very easily held back by a woman and small boy who happen to join the
group. He contents himself with pretending to be in a great passion and
biting his finger, which gesture may be collated with the emotional
clinching of the teeth and biting the lips in anger, common to all
mankind.</p>

<p>In Fig. 90 a contadina, or woman from the country, who has come to
the city to sell eggs (shown to be such by her head-dress, and the form
of the basket which she has deposited on the ground), accosts a vender
of roast chestnuts and asks for a measure of them. The chestnut huckster
says they are very fine and asks a price beyond that of the market; but
a boy sees that the rustic woman is not sharp in worldly matters and
desires to warn her against the cheat. He therefore, at the moment when
he can catch her eye, pretending to lean upon his basket, and moving
thus a little behind the huckster, so as not to be seen, points him out
with his index finger, and lays his left forefinger under his eye,
pulling down the skin slightly, so as to deform the regularity of the
lower
<span class = "pagenum">302</span>
<a name = "page302" id = "page302"> </a>
eyelid. This is a <i>warning against a cheat</i>, shown more clearly in
Fig. 91. This sign primarily indicates a squinting person, and
metaphorically one whose looks cannot be trusted, even as in a squinting
person you cannot be certain in which direction he is looking.</p>

<p>Fig. 92 shows the extremities of the index and thumb closely joined
in form of a cone, and turned down, the other fingers held at pleasure,
and the hand and arm advanced to the point and held steady. This
signifies <i>justice</i>, a just person, that which is just and right.
The same sign may denote friendship, a&nbsp;menace, which specifically
is that of being brought to justice, and snuff, <i>i.e.</i> powdered
tobacco; but the expression of the countenance and the circumstance of
the use of the sign determine these distinctions. Its origin is clearly
the balance or emblem of justice, the office of which consists in
ascertaining physical weight, and thence comes the moral idea of
distinguishing clearly what is just and accurate and what is not. The
hand is presented in the usual manner of holding the balance to weigh
articles.</p>

<p>Fig. 93 signifies <i>little, small</i>, both as regards the size of
physical objects or figuratively, as of a small degree of talent,
affection, or the like. It is made either by the point of the thumb
placed under the end of the index (<i>a</i>), or <i>vice versâ</i>
(<i>b</i>), and the other fingers held at will, but separated from those
mentioned. The intention is to exhibit a small portion either of the
thumb or index separated from the rest of the hand. The gesture is found
in Herculanean bronzes, with obviously the same signification. The signs
made by some tribes of Indians for the same conception are very similar,
as is seen by Figs. 94 and 95.</p>

<p>Fig. 96 is simply the index extended by itself. The other fingers are
generally bent inwards and pressed down by the thumb, as mentioned by
Quintilian, but that is not necessary to the gesture if the forefinger
is distinctly separated from the rest. It is most commonly used for
indication, pointing out, as it is over all the world, from which comes
the name index, applied by the Romans as also by us, to the forefinger.
In different relations to the several parts of the body and arm
positions it has many significations, <i>e.g.</i>, attention,
meditation, derision, silence, number, and demonstration in general.</p>

<p>Fig. 98 is intended to portray the head of the same animal in a front
view, the hands being laid upon each other, with thumbs extending on
each side to represent the ears. In each case the thumbs are generally
moved forward and back, in the manner of the quadruped, which, without
much apparent reason, has been selected as the emblem of stupidity. The
sign, therefore, means <i>stupid, fool</i>. Another mode of executing
the same conception&mdash;the ears of an ass&mdash;is shown in Fig. 99,
where the end of the thumb is applied to the ear or temple and the hand
is wagged up and down. Whether the ancient Greeks had the same low
opinion of the ass as is now entertained is not clear, but they regarded
long ears with derision, and Apollo, as a punishment to Midas for his
foolish decision, bestowed on him the lengthy ornaments of the patient
beast.</p>

<p>Fig. 100 is the fingers elongated and united in a point, turned
upwards. The hand is raised slightly toward the face of the gesturer and
shaken a few times in the direction of the person conversed with. This
is <i>inquiry</i>, not a mere interrogative, but to express that the
person addressed has not been clearly understood, perhaps from the
vagueness or diffusiveness of his expressions. The idea appears to
suggest the gathering of his thoughts together into one distinct
expression, or to be <i>pointed</i> in what he wishes to say.</p>

<p><i>Crafty, deceitful</i>, Fig. 101. The little fingers of both
reversed hands are hooked together, the others open but slightly curved,
and, with the hands, moved several times to the right and left. The
gesture is intended to represent a crab and the tortuous movements of
the crustacean, which are likened to those of a man who cannot be
depended on in his walk through life. He is not straight.</p>

<p>Figs. 102 and 103 are different positions of the hand in which the
approximating thumb and forefinger form a circle. This is the direst

special significance, but it may be evident to persons aware of a

Fig. 105.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 104 is easily recognized as a request or command to be
<i>silent</i>, either on the occasion or on the subject. The mouth,
supposed to be forcibly closed, prevents speaking, and the natural
gesture, as might be supposed, is historically ancient, but the
instance, frequently adduced from the attitude of the god Harpokrates,
whose finger is on his lips, is an error. The Egyptian hieroglyphists,
notably in the designation of Horus, their dawn-god, used the finger in
or on the lips for “child.” It has been conjectured in the last instance
that the gesture implied, not the mode of taking nourishment, but
inability to speak&mdash;<i>in-fans</i>. This conjecture, however, was
only made to explain the blunder of the Greeks, who saw in the hand
placed connected with the mouth in the hieroglyph of Horus (the) son,
“Hor-(p)-chrot,” the gesture familiar to themselves of a finger on the
lips to express “silence,” and so, mistaking both the name and the
characterization, invented the God of Silence, Harpokrates.
A&nbsp;careful examination of all the linear hieroglyphs given by
Champollion (<i>Dictionnaire <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Egyptien’">Égyptien</ins></i>) shows that the finger or the hand
to the mouth of an adult (whose posture is always distinct from that of
a child) is always in connection with the positive ideas of voice,
mouth, speech, writing, eating, drinking, &amp;c., and never with the
negative idea of silence. The special character for <i>child</i>, Fig.
105, always has the above-mentioned part of the sign with reference to
nourishment from the breast.</p>

<p>Fig. 106 is a forcible <i>negation</i>. The outer ends of the fingers
united in a point under the chin are violently thrust forward. This is
the rejection of an idea or proposition, the same conception being
executed in several different modes by the North American Indians.</p>

<p>Fig. 107 signifies <i>hunger</i>, and is made by extending the thumb
and index under the open mouth and turning them horizontally and
vertically several times. The idea is emptiness and desire to be filled.
It is also expressed by beating the ribs with the flat hands, to show
that the sides meet or are weak for the want of something between
them.</p>

<p>Fig. 108 is made in mocking and ridicule. The open and oscillating
<span class = "pagenum">305</span>
<a name = "page305" id = "page305"> </a>
hand touches the point of the nose with that of the thumb. It has the
particular sense of stigmatizing the person addressed or in question as
a dupe. A&nbsp;credulous person is generally imagined with a gaping
mouth and staring eyes, and as thrusting forward his face, with pendant
chin, so that the nose is well advanced and therefore most prominent in
the profile. A&nbsp;dupe is therefore called <i>naso lungo</i> or
long-nose, and with Italian writers “<i>restare con un palmo di
naso</i>”&mdash;to be left with a palm’s length of nose&mdash;means to
have met with loss, injury, or disappointment.</p>

<p>The thumb stroking the forehead from one side to the other, Fig. 109,
is a natural sign of <i>fatigue</i>, and of the physical toil that
produces fatigue. The wiping off of perspiration is obviously indicated.
This gesture is often used ironically.</p>

<p>As a <i>dupe</i> was shown above, now the <i>duper</i> is signified,
by Fig. 110. The gesture is to place the fingers between the cravat and
the neck and rub the latter with the back of the hand. The idea is that
the deceit is put within the cravat, taken in and down, similar to our
phrase to “swallow” a&nbsp;false and deceitful story, and a “cram” is
also an English slang word for an incredible lie. The conception of the
slang term is nearly related to that of the Neapolitan sign, viz., the
artificial enlargement of the œsophagus of the person victimized or on
whom imposition is attempted to be practiced, which is necessary to take
it down.</p>

<p>Fig. 111 shows the ends of the index and thumb stroking the two sides
of the nose from base to point. This means <i>astute, attentive,
ready</i>. Sharpness of the nasal organ is popularly associated with
subtlety and finesse. The old Romans by <i>homo emunctæ naris</i> meant
an acute man attentive to his interests. The sign is often used in a bad
sense, then signifying <i>too</i> sharp to be trusted.</p>

<p>This somewhat lengthy but yet only partial list of Neapolitan
gesture-signs must conclude with one common throughout Italy, and also
among us with a somewhat different signification, yet perhaps also
derived from classic times. To
<span class = "pagenum">306</span>
<a name = "page306" id = "page306"> </a>
express suspicion of a person the forefinger of the right hand is placed
upon the side of the nose. It means <i>tainted</i>, not sound. It is
used to give an unfavorable report of a person inquired of and to warn
against such.</p>


<p class = "space">
The Chinese, though ready in gesticulation and divided by dialects, do
not appear to make general use of a systematic sign language, but they
adopt an expedient rendered possible by the peculiarity of their written
characters, with which a large proportion of their adults are
acquainted, and which are common in form to the whole empire. The
inhabitants of different provinces when meeting, and being unable to
converse orally, do not try to do so, but write the characters of the
words upon the ground or trace them on the palm of the hand or in the
air. Those written characters each represent words in the same manner as
do the Arabic or Roman numerals, which are the same to Italians,
Germans, French, and English, and therefore intelligible, but if
expressed in sound or written in full by the alphabet, would not be
mutually understood. This device of the Chinese was with less apparent
necessity resorted to in the writer’s personal knowledge between a
Hungarian who could talk Latin, and a then recent graduate from college
who could also do so to some extent, but their pronunciation was so
different as to occasion constant difficulty, so they both wrote the
words on paper, instead of attempting to speak them.</p>

<p>The efforts at intercommunication of all savage and barbarian tribes,
when brought into contact with other bodies of men not speaking an oral
language common to both, and especially when uncivilized inhabitants of
the same territory are separated by many linguistic divisions, should in
theory resemble the devices of the North American Indians. They are not
shown by published works to prevail in the Eastern hemisphere to the
same extent and in the same manner as in North America. It is, however,
probable that they exist in many localities, though not reported, and
also that some of them survive after partial or even high civilization
has been attained, and after changed environment has rendered their
systematic employment unnecessary. Such signs may be, first, unconnected
with existing oral language, and used in place of it; second, used to
explain or accentuate the words of ordinary speech, or third, they may
consist of gestures, emotional or not, which are only noticed in oratory
or impassioned conversation, being, possibly, survivals of a former
gesture language.</p>

<p>From correspondence instituted it may be expected that a considerable
collection of signs will be obtained from West and South Africa, India,
Arabia, Turkey, the Fiji Islands, Sumatra, Madagascar, Ceylon, and
especially from Australia, where the conditions are similar in many
respects to those prevailing in North America prior to the Columbian
discovery. In the <i>Aborigines of Victoria</i>, <i>Melbourne</i>, 1878,
by R.&nbsp;Brough Smythe, the author makes the following curious
remarks: “It is believed that they have several signs, known only to
themselves, or to those
<span class = "pagenum">307</span>
<a name = "page307" id = "page307"> </a>
among the whites who have had intercourse with them for lengthened
periods, which convey information readily and accurately. Indeed,
because of their use of signs, it is the firm belief of many (some
uneducated and some educated) that the natives of Australia are
acquainted with the secrets of Freemasonry.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Report of the cruise of the United States Revenue steamer
Corwin in the Arctic Ocean</i>, <i>Washington</i>, 1881, it appears that
the Innuits of the northwestern extremity of America use signs
continually. Captain Hooper, commanding that steamer, is reported by Mr.
Petroff to have found that the natives of Nunivak Island, on the
American side, below Behring Strait, trade by signs with those of the
Asiatic coast, whose language is different. Humboldt in his journeyings
among the Indians of the Orinoco, where many small isolated tribes spoke
languages not understood by any other, found the language of signs in
full operation. Spix and Martius give a similar account of the Puris and
Coroados of Brazil.</p>


<p class = "space">
It is not necessary to enlarge under the present heading upon the signs
of deaf-mutes, except to show the intimate relation between sign
language as practiced by them and the gesture signs, which, even if not
“natural,” are intelligible to the most widely separated of mankind.
A&nbsp;Sandwich Islander, a&nbsp;Chinese, and the Africans from the
slaver Amistad have, in published instances, visited our deaf-mute
institutions with the same result of free and pleasurable intercourse;
and an English deaf-mute had no difficulty in conversing with
Laplanders. It appears, also, on the authority of Sibscota, whose
treatise was published in 1670, that Cornelius Haga, ambassador of the
United Provinces to the Sublime Porte, found the Sultan’s mutes to have
established a language among themselves in which they could discourse
with a speaking interpreter, a&nbsp;degree of ingenuity interfering with
the object of their selection as slaves unable to repeat conversation.
A&nbsp;curious instance has also been reported to the writer of
operatives in a large mill where the constant rattling of the machinery
rendered them practically deaf during the hours of work and where an
original system of gestures was adopted.</p>

<p>In connection with the late international convention, at Milan, of
persons interested in the instruction of deaf-mutes which, in the
enthusiasm of the members for the new system of artificial articulate
speech, made war upon all gesture-signs, it is curious that such
prohibition of gesture should be urged regarding mutes when it was
prevalent to so great an extent among the speaking people of the country
where the convention was held, and when the advocates of it were
themselves so dependent on gestures to assist their own oratory if not
their ordinary conversation. Artificial articulation surely needs the
aid of significant gestures more, when in the highest perfection to
which it can attain, than does oral speech in its own high development.
The use of artificial speech is also necessarily confined to the oral
language acquired by the interlocutors and throws away the advantage of
universality possessed by signs.</p>

USE BY MODERN ACTORS AND ORATORS.</a></h4>

<p>Less of practical value can be learned of sign language, considered
as a system, from the study of gestures of actors and orators than would
appear without reflection. The pantomimist who uses no words whatever is
obliged to avail himself of every natural or imagined connection between
thought and gesture, and, depending wholly on the latter, makes himself
intelligible. On the stage and the rostrum words are the main reliance,
and gestures generally serve for rhythmic movement and to display
personal grace. At the most they give the appropriate representation of
the general idea expressed by the words, but do not attempt to indicate
the idea itself. An instance is recorded of the addition of significance
to gesture when it is employed by the gesturer, himself silent, to
accompany words used by another. Livius Andronicus, being hoarse,
obtained permission to have his part sung by another actor while he
continued to make the gestures, and he did so with much greater effect
than before, as Livy, the historian, explains, because he was not
impeded by the exertion of the voice; but the correct explanation
probably is, because his attention was directed to ideas, not mere
words.</p>

<h5>GESTURES OF ACTORS.</h5>

<p>To look at the performance of a play through thick glass or with
closed ears has much the same absurd effect that is produced by also
stopping the ears while at a ball and watching the apparently objectless
capering of the dancers, without the aid of musical accompaniment.
Diderot, in his <i>Lettre sur les sourds muets</i>, gives his experience
as follows:</p>

<p>“I used frequently to attend the theater and I knew by heart most of
our good plays. Whenever I wished to criticise the movements and
gestures of the actors I went to the third tier of boxes, for the
further I was from them the better I was situated for this purpose. As
soon as the curtain rose, and the moment came when the other spectators
disposed themselves to listen, I&nbsp;put my fingers into my ears, not
without causing some surprise among those who surrounded me, who, not
understanding, almost regarded me as a crazy man who had come to the
play only not to hear it. I&nbsp;was very little embarrassed by their
comments, however, and obstinately kept my ears closed as long as the
action and gestures of the players seemed to me to accord with the
discourse which I recollected. I&nbsp;listened only when I failed to see
the appropriateness of the gestures. <span class = "ellipsis">***</span>
There are few actors capable of sustaining such a test, and the details
into which I could enter would be mortifying to most of them.”</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Diderot made this test with regard to the
appropriate gestural representation of plays that he knew by heart, but
if he had been entirely without any knowledge of the plot, the
difficulty in his comprehending it from gestures alone would have been
enormously increased. When many admirers of Ristori, who were wholly
unacquainted
<span class = "pagenum">309</span>
<a name = "page309" id = "page309"> </a>
with the language in which her words were delivered, declared that her
gesture and expression were so perfect that they understood every
sentence, it is to be doubted if they would have been so delighted if
they had not been thoroughly familiar with the plots of Queen Elizabeth
and Mary Stuart. This view is confirmed by the case of a deaf-mute, told
to the writer by Professor <span class = "smallcaps">Fay</span>, who had
prepared to enjoy Ristori’s acting by reading in advance the advertised
play, but on his reaching the theater another play was substituted and
he could derive no idea from its presentation. The experience of the
present writer is that he could gain very little meaning in detail out
of the performance at a Chinese theater, where there is much more true
pantomime than in the European, without a general notion of the subject
as conveyed from time to time by an interpreter. A&nbsp;crucial test on
this subject was made at the representation at Washington, in April,
1881, of <i>Frou-Frou</i> by Sarah Bernhardt and the excellent French
company supporting her. Several persons of special intelligence and
familiar with theatrical performances, but who did not understand spoken
French, and had not heard or read the play before or even seen an
abstract of it, paid close attention to ascertain what they could learn
of the plot and incidents from the gestures alone. This could be
determined in the special play the more certainly as it is not founded
on historic events or any known facts. The result was that from the
entrance of the heroine during the first scene in a peacock-blue riding
habit to her death in a black walking-suit, three hours or five acts
later, none of the students formed any distinct conception of the plot.
This want of apprehension extended even to uncertainty whether
<i>Gilberte</i> was married or not; that is, whether her adventures were
those of a disobedient daughter or a faithless wife, and, if married,
which of the half dozen male personages was her husband. There were
gestures enough, indeed rather a profusion of them, and they were
thoroughly appropriate to the words (when those were understood) in
which fun, distress, rage, and other emotions were expressed, but in no
cases did they interpret the motive for those emotions. They were the
dressing for the words of the actors as the superb millinery was that of
their persons, and perhaps acted as varnish to bring out dialogues and
soliloquies in heightened effect. But though varnish can bring into
plainer view dull or faded characters, it cannot introduce into them
significance where none before existed. The simple fact was that the
gestures of the most famed histrionic school, the Comédie Française,
were not significant, far less self-interpreting, and though praised as
the perfection of art, have diverged widely from nature. It thus appears
that the absence of absolute self-interpretation by gesture is by no
means confined to the lower grade of actors, such as are criticised in
the old lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>When to enforce some very tender part</p>
<p>His <ins class = "correction" title =
"error for ‘right’: see transcriber’s note">left</ins>
hand sleeps by instinct on the heart;</p>
<p>His soul, of every other thought bereft,</p>
<p>Seems anxious only&mdash;where to place the left!</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">310</span>
<a name = "page310" id = "page310"> </a>
<p>Without relying wholly upon the facts above mentioned, it will be
admitted upon reflection that however numerous and correct may be the
actually significant gestures made by a great actor in the
representation of his part, they must be in small proportion to the
number of gestures not at all significant, and which are no less
necessary to give to his declamation precision, grace, and force.
Significant gestures on the stage may be regarded in the nature of high
seasoning and ornamentation, which by undue use defeat their object and
create disgust. Histrionic perfection is, indeed, more shown in the
slight shades of movement of the head, glances of the eye, and poises of
the body than in violent attitudes; but these slight movements are
wholly unintelligible without the words uttered with them. Even in the
expression of strong emotion the same gesture will apply to many and
utterly diverse conditions of fact. The greatest actor in telling that
his father was dead can convey his grief with a shade of difference from
that which he would use if saying that his wife had run away, his son
been arrested for murder, or his house burned down; but that shade would
not without words inform any person, ignorant of the supposed event,
which of the four misfortunes had occurred. A&nbsp;true sign language,
however, would fully express the exact circumstances, either with or
without any exhibition of the general emotion appropriate to them.</p>

<p>Even among the best sign-talkers, whether Indian or deaf-mute, it is
necessary to establish some <i>rapport</i> relating to theme or
subject-matter, since many gestures, as indeed is the case in a less
degree with spoken words, have widely different significations,
according to the object of their exhibition, as well as the context.
Panurge (<i>Pantagruel</i>, Book III, ch. xix) hits the truth upon this
point, however ungallant in his application of it to the fair sex. He is
desirous to consult a dumb man, but says it would be useless to apply to
a woman, for “whatever it be that they see they do always represent unto
their fancies, and imagine that it hath some relation to love. Whatever
signs, shows, or gestures we shall make, or whatever our behavior,
carriage, or demeanor shall happen to be in their view and presence,
they will interpret the whole in reference to androgynation.”
A&nbsp;story is told to the same point by Guevara, in his fabulous life
of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. A&nbsp;young Roman gentleman
encountering at the foot of Mount Celion a beautiful Latin lady, who
from her very cradle had been deaf and dumb, asked her in gesture what
senators in her descent from the top of the hill she had met with, going
up thither. She straightway imagined that he had fallen in love with her
and was eloquently proposing marriage, whereupon she at once threw
herself into his arms in acceptance. The experience of travelers on the
Plains is to the same general effect, that signs commonly used to men
are understood by women in a sense so different as to occasion
embarrassment. So necessary was it to strike the mental key-note of the
spectators by adapting their minds to time, place, and circumstance,
that even in the palmiest days of pantomime
<span class = "pagenum">311</span>
<a name = "page311" id = "page311"> </a>
it was customary for the crier to give some short preliminary
explanation of what was to be acted, which advantage is now retained by
our play-bills, always more specific when the performance is in a
foreign language, unless, indeed, the management is interested in the
sale of librettos.</p>

<h5>GESTURES OF OUR PUBLIC SPEAKERS.</h5>

<p>If the scenic gestures are so seldom significant, those appropriate
to oratory are of course still less so. They require energy, variety,
and precision, but also a degree of simplicity which is incompatible
with the needs of sign language. As regards imitation, they are
restrained within narrow bounds and are equally suited to a great
variety of sentiments. Among the admirable illustrations in Austin’s
<i>Chironomia</i> of gestures applicable to the several passages in
Gay’s “Miser and Plutus” one is given for “But virtue’s sold” which is
perfectly appropriate, but is not in the slightest degree suggestive
either of virtue or of the transaction of sale. It could be used for an
indefinite number of thoughts or objects which properly excited
abhorrence, and therefore without the words gives no special
interpretation. Oratorical delivery demands general grace&mdash;cannot
rely upon the emotions of the moment for spontaneous appropriateness,
and therefore requires preliminary study and practice, such as are
applied to dancing and fencing with a similar object; indeed,
accomplishment in both dancing and fencing has been recommended as of
use to all orators. In reference to this subject a quotation from Lord
Chesterfield’s letters is in place: “I&nbsp;knew a young man, who, being
just elected a member of Parliament, was laughed at for being
discovered, through the key-hole of his chamber door, speaking to
himself in the glass and forming his looks and gestures. I&nbsp;could
not join in that laugh, but, on the contrary, thought him much wiser
than those that laughed at him, for he knew the importance of those
little graces in a public assembly and they did not.”</p>

OUR INDIAN CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO SIGN LANGUAGE.</a></h3>

<p>In no other thoroughly explored part of the world has there been
found spread over so large a space so small a number of individuals
divided by so many linguistic and dialectic boundaries as in North
America. Many wholly distinct tongues have for an indefinitely long time
been confined to a few scores of speakers, verbally incomprehensible to
all others on the face of the earth who did not, from some rarely
operating motive, laboriously acquire their language. Even when the
American race, so styled, flourished in the greatest population of which
we have any evidence (at&nbsp;least according to the published views of
the present writer, which seem to have been generally accepted), the
immense number of languages and dialects still preserved, or known by
<span class = "pagenum">312</span>
<a name = "page312" id = "page312"> </a>
early recorded fragments to have once existed, so subdivided it that
only the dwellers in a very few villages could talk together with ease.
They were all interdistributed among unresponsive vernaculars, each to
the other being <i>bar-bar-ous</i> in every meaning of the term. The
number of known stocks or families of Indian languages within the
territory of the United States amounts now to sixty-five, and these
differ among themselves as radically as each differs from the Hebrew,
Chinese, or English. In each of these linguistic families there are
several, sometimes as many as twenty, separate languages, which also
differ from each other as much as do the English, French, German, and
Persian divisions of the Aryan linguistic stock.</p>

<p>The use of gesture-signs, continued, if not originating, in necessity
for communication with the outer world, became entribally convenient
from the habits of hunters, the main occupation of all savages,
depending largely upon stealthy approach to game, and from the sole form
of their military tactics&mdash;to surprise an enemy. In the still
expanse of virgin forests, and especially in the boundless solitudes of
the great plains, a&nbsp;slight sound can be heard over a large area,
that of the human voice being from its rarity the most startling, so
that it is now, as it probably has been for centuries, a&nbsp;common
precaution for members of a hunting or war party not to speak together
when on such expeditions, communicating exclusively by signs. The
acquired habit also exhibits itself not only in formal oratory and in
impassioned or emphatic conversation, but also as a picturesque
accompaniment to ordinary social talk. Hon. <span class =
"smallcaps">Lewis H. Morgan</span> mentions in a letter to this writer
that he found a silent but happy family composed of an Atsina (commonly
called Gros Ventre of the Prairie) woman, who had been married two years
to a Frenchman, during which time they had neither of them attempted to
learn each other’s language; but the husband having taken kindly to the
language of signs, they conversed together by that means with great
contentment. It is also often resorted to in mere laziness, one gesture
saving many words. The gracefulness, ingenuity, and apparent spontaneity
of the greater part of the signs can never be realized until actually
witnessed, and their beauty is much heightened by the free play to which
the arms of these people are accustomed, and the small and well-shaped
hands for which they are remarkable. Among them can seldom be noticed in
literal fact&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>The graceless action of a heavy hand&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>which the Bastard metaphorically condemns in King John.</p>

<p>The conditions upon which the survival of sign language among the
Indians has depended is well shown by those attending its discontinuance
among certain tribes.</p>

<p>Many instances are known of the discontinuance of gesture speech with
no development in the native language of the gesturers, but from the
invention for intercommunication of one used in common. The
<span class = "pagenum">313</span>
<a name = "page313" id = "page313"> </a>
Kalapuyas of Southern Oregon until recently used a sign language, but
have gradually adopted for foreign intercourse the composite tongue,
commonly called the Tsinuk or Chinook jargon, which probably arose for
trade purposes on the Columbia River before the advent of Europeans,
founded on the Tsinuk, Tsihali, Nutka, &amp;c., but now enriched by
English and French terms, and have nearly forgotten their old signs. The
prevalence of this mongrel speech, originating in the same causes that
produced the pigeon-English or <i>lingua-franca</i> of the Orient,
explains the marked scantiness of sign language among the tribes of the
Northwest coast.</p>

<p>Where the Chinook jargon has not extended on the coast to the North,
the Russian language commences, used in the same manner, but it has not
reached so deeply into the interior of the continent as the Chinook,
which has been largely adopted within the region bounded by the eastern
line of Oregon and Washington, and has become known even to the Pai-Utes
of Nevada. The latter, however, while using it with the Oregonian tribes
to their west and north, still keep up sign language for communication
with the Banaks, who have not become so familiar with the Chinook. The
Alaskan tribes on the coast also used signs not more than a generation
ago, as is proved by the fact that some of the older men can yet
converse by this means with the natives of the interior, whom they
occasionally meet. Before the advent of the Russians the coast tribes
traded their dried fish and oil for the skins and paints of the eastern
tribes by visiting the latter, whom they did not allow to come to the
coast, and this trade was conducted mainly in sign language. The
Russians brought a better market, so the travel to the interior ceased,
and with it the necessity for the signs, which therefore gradually died
out, and are little known to the present generation on the coast, though
still continuing in the interior, where the inhabitants are divided by
dialects.</p>

<p>No explanation is needed for the disuse of a language of signs for
the special purpose now in question when the speech of surrounding
civilization is recognized as necessary or important to be acquired, and
gradually becomes known as the best common medium, even before it is
actually spoken by many individuals of the several tribes. When it has
become general, signs, as systematically employed before, gradually fade
away.</p>

THEORIES ENTERTAINED RESPECTING INDIAN SIGNS.</a></h3>

<p>In this paper it is not designed to pronounce upon theories, and
certainly none will be advocated in a spirit of dogmatism. The writer
recognizes that the subject in its novelty specially requires an
objective and not a subjective consideration. His duty is to collect the
facts as they are, and this as soon as possible, since every year will
add to the
<span class = "pagenum">314</span>
<a name = "page314" id = "page314"> </a>
confusion and difficulty. After the facts are established the theories
will take care of themselves, and their final enunciation will be in the
hands of men more competent than the writer will ever pretend to be,
although his knowledge, after careful study of all data attainable, may
be considerably increased. The mere collection of facts, however, cannot
be prosecuted to advantage without predetermined rules of judgment, nor
can they be classified at all without the adoption of some principle
which involves a tentative theory. More than a generation ago Baader
noticed that scientific observers only accumulated great masses of
separate facts without establishing more connection between them than an
arbitrary and imperfect classification; and before him Goethe complained
of the indisposition of students of nature to look upon the universe as
a whole. But since the great theory of evolution has been brought to
general notice no one will be satisfied at knowing a fact without also
trying to establish its relation to other facts. Therefore a working
hypothesis, which shall not be held to with tenacity, is not only
allowable but necessary. It is also important to examine with proper
respect the theories advanced by others. Some of these, suggested in the
few publications on the subject and also by correspondents, will be
mentioned.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_theories_meager" id = "sign_theories_meager">
NOT CORRELATED WITH MEAGERNESS OF LANGUAGE.</a></h4>

<p>The story has been told by travelers in many parts of the world that
various languages cannot be clearly understood in the dark by their
possessors, using their mother tongue between themselves. The evidence
for this anywhere is suspicious; and when it is asserted, as it often
has been, in reference to some of the tribes of North American Indians,
it is absolutely false, and must be attributed to the error of travelers
who, ignorant of the dialect, never see the natives except when trying
to make themselves intelligible to their visitors by a practice which
they have found by experience to have been successful with strangers to
their tongue, or perhaps when they are guarding against being overheard
by others. Captain Burton, in his <i>City of the Saints</i>, specially
states that the Arapahos possess a very scanty vocabulary, pronounced in
a quasi-unintelligible way, and can hardly converse with one another in
the dark. The truth is that their vocabulary is by no means scanty, and
they do converse with each other with perfect freedom without any
gestures when they so please. The difficulty in speaking or
understanding their language is in the large number of guttural and
interrupted sounds which are not helped by external motions of the mouth
and lips in articulation, and the light gives little advantage to its
comprehension so far as concerns the vocal apparatus, which, in many
languages, can be seen as well as heard, as is proved by the modern
deaf-mute practice of artificial speech. The corresponding story that no
white man ever learned Arapaho is also false. A&nbsp;member of Frémont’s
party so long ago as 1842 spoke the language. Burton in the same
connection
<span class = "pagenum">315</span>
<a name = "page315" id = "page315"> </a>
gives a story “of a man who, being sent among the Cheyennes to qualify
himself for interpreting, returned in a week and proved his competency;
all he did, however, was to go through the usual pantomime with a
running accompaniment of grunts.” And he might as well have omitted the
grunts, for he obviously only used sign language. Lieutenant Abert, in
1846-’47, made much more sensible remarks from his actual observation
than Captain Burton repeated at second-hand from a Mormon met by him at
Salt Lake. He said: “Some persons think that it [the Cheyenne language]
would be incomplete without gesture, because the Indians use gestures
constantly. But I have been assured that the language is in itself
capable of bodying forth any idea to which one may wish to give
utterance.”</p>

<p>In fact, individuals of those American tribes specially instanced in
these reports as unable to converse without gesture, often, in their
domestic <i>abandon</i>, wrap themselves up in robes or blankets with
only breathing holes before the nose, so that no part of the body is
seen, and chatter away for hours, telling long stories. If in daylight
they thus voluntarily deprive themselves of the possibility of making
signs, it is clear that their preference for talks around the fire at
night is explicable by very natural reasons wholly distinct from the one
attributed. The inference, once carelessly made from the free use of
gesture by some of the Shoshonian stock, that their tongue was too
meager for use without signs, is refuted by the now ascertained fact
that their vocabulary is remarkably copious and their parts of speech
better differentiated than those of many people on whom no such stigma
has been affixed. The proof of this was seen in the writer’s experience,
when Ouray, the head chief of the Utes, was at Washington, in the early
part of 1880, and after an interview with the Secretary of the Interior
made report of it to the rest of the delegation who had not been
present. He spoke without pause in his own language for nearly an hour,
in a monotone and without a single gesture. The reason for this
depressed manner was undoubtedly because he was very sad at the result,
involving loss of land and change of home; but the fact remains that
full information was communicated on a complicated subject without the
aid of a manual sign, and also without even such change of inflection of
voice as is common among Europeans. All theories based upon the supposed
poverty of American languages must be abandoned.</p>

<p>The grievous accusation against foreign people that they have no
intelligible language is venerable and general. With the Greeks the term
<span class = "greek" lang = "el" title = "aglôssos">ἄγλωσσος</span>,
“tongueless,” was used synonymous with <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "barbaros">βάρβαρος</span>, “barbarian” of all who were not
Greek. The name “Slav,” assumed by a grand division of the Aryan family,
means “the speaker,” and is contradistinguished from the other peoples
of the world, such as the Germans, who are called in Russian “Njemez,”
that is, “speechless.” In Isaiah (xxxiii,&nbsp;19) the Assyrians are
called a people “of a stammering tongue, that one cannot understand.”
The common use of the expression
<span class = "pagenum">316</span>
<a name = "page316" id = "page316"> </a>
“tongueless” and “speechless,” so applied, has probably given rise, as
<span class = "smallcaps">Tylor</span> suggests, to the mythical stories
of actually speechless tribes of savages, and the considerations and
instances above presented tend to discredit the many other accounts of
languages which are incomplete without the help of gesture. The theory
that sign language was in whole or in chief the original utterance of
mankind would be strongly supported by conclusive evidence to the truth
of such travelers’ tales, but does not depend upon them. Nor,
considering the immeasurable period during which, in accordance with
modern geologic views, man has been on the earth, is it probable that
any existing races can be found in which speech has not obviated the
absolute necessity for gesture in communication among themselves. The
signs survive for convenience, used together with oral language, and for
special employment when language is unavailable.</p>

<p>A comparison sometimes drawn between sign language and that of our
Indians, founded on the statement of their common poverty in abstract
expressions, is not just to either. This paper will be written in vain
if it shall not suggest the capacities of gesture speech in that regard,
and a deeper study into Indian tongues has shown that they are by no
means so confined to the concrete as was once believed.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_theories_region" id = "sign_theories_region">
ITS ORIGIN FROM ONE TRIBE OR REGION.</a></h4>

<p>Col. Richard I. Dodge, United States Army, whose long experience
among the Indians entitles his opinion to great respect, says in a
letter:</p>

<p>“The embodiment of signs into a systematic language is, I believe,
confined to the Indians of the Plains. Contiguous tribes gain, here and
there, a&nbsp;greater or less knowledge of this language; these again
extend the knowledge, diminished and probably perverted, to their
neighbors, until almost all the Indian tribes of the United States east
of the Sierras have some little smattering of it. The Plains Indians
believe the Kiowas to have invented the sign language, and that by them
its use was communicated to other Plains tribes. If this is correct,
analogy would lead us to believe that those tribes most nearly in
contact with the Kiowas would use it most fluently and correctly, the
knowledge becoming less as the contact diminishes. Thus the Utes, though
nearly contiguous (in&nbsp;territory) to the Plains Indians, have only
the merest ‘picked up’ knowledge of this language, and never use it
among themselves, simply because, they and the Plains tribes having
been, since the memory of their oldest men, in a chronic state of war,
there has been no social contact.”</p>

<p>In another communication Colonel Dodge is still more definite:</p>

<p>“The Plains Indians themselves believe the sign language was invented
by the Kiowas, who holding an intermediate position between the
Comanches, Tonkaways, Lipans, and other inhabitants of the vast plains
of Texas, and the Pawnees, Sioux, Blackfeet, and other northern tribes,
were the general go-betweens, trading with all, making peace or war
<span class = "pagenum">317</span>
<a name = "page317" id = "page317"> </a>
with or for any or all. It is certain that the Kiowas are at present
more universally proficient in this language than any other Plains
tribe. It is also certain that the tribes farthest away from them and
with whom they have least intercourse use it with least facility.”</p>

<p>Dr. William H. Corbusier, assistant surgeon United States Army,
a&nbsp;valued contributor, gives information as follows:</p>

<p>“The traditions of the Indians point toward the south as the
direction from which the sign language came. They refer to the time when
they did not use it; and each tribe say they learned it from those south
of them. The Comanches, who acquired it in Mexico, taught it to the
Arapahoes and Kiowas, and from these the Cheyennes learned it. The Sioux
say that they had no knowledge of it before they crossed the Missouri
River and came in contact with the Cheyennes, but have quite recently
learned it from them. It would thus appear that the Plains Indians did
not invent it, but finding it adapted to their wants adopted it as a
convenient means of communicating with those whose language they did not
understand, and it rapidly spread from tribe to tribe over the Plains.
As the sign language came from Mexico, the Spaniards suggest themselves
as the introducers of it on this continent. They are adepts in the use
of signs. Cortez as he marched through Mexico would naturally have
resorted to signs in communicating with the numerous tribes with which
he came in contract. Finding them very necessary, one sign after another
would suggest itself and be adopted by Spaniards and Indians, and, as
the former advanced, one tribe after another would learn to use them.
The Indians on the Plains, finding them so useful, preserved them and
each tribe modified them to suit their convenience, but the signs
remained essentially the same. The Shoshones took the sign language with
them as they moved northwest, and a few of the Piutes may have learned
it from them, but the Piutes as a tribe do not use it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ben. Clarke, the respected and skillful interpreter at Fort Reno
writes to the same general effect:</p>

<p>“The Cheyennes think that the sign language used by the Cheyennes,
Arapahoes, Ogallala and Brulé Sioux, Kiowas, and Comanches originated
with the Kiowas. It is a tradition that, many years ago, when the
Northern Indians were still without horses, the Kiowas often raided
among the Mexican Indians and captured droves of horses on these trips.
The Northern Plains Indians used to journey to them and trade for
horses. The Kiowas were already proficient in signs, and the others
learned from them. It was the journeying to the South that finally
divided the Cheyennes, making the Northern and Southern Cheyennes. The
same may be said of the Arapahoes. That the Kiowas were the first sign
talkers is only a tradition, but as a tribe they are now considered to
be the best or most thorough of the Plains Indians.”</p>

<p>Without engaging in any controversy on this subject it may be noticed
that the theory advanced supposes a comparatively recent origin of sign
<span class = "pagenum">318</span>
<a name = "page318" id = "page318"> </a>
language from one tribe and one region, whereas, so far as can be
traced, the conditions favorable to a sign language existed very long
ago and were co-extensive with the territory of North America occupied
by any of the tribes. To avoid repetition reference is made to the
discussion below under the heads of universality, antiquity, identity,
and permanence. At this point it is only desired to call attention to
the ancient prevalence of signs among tribes such as the Iroquois,
Wyandot, Ojibwa, and at least three generations back among the Crees
beyond our northern boundary and the Mandans and other far-northern
Dakotas, not likely at that time to have had communication, even through
intertribal channels, with the Kaiowas. It is also difficult to
understand how their signs would have in that manner reached the Kutchin
of Eastern Alaska and the Kutine and Selish of British Columbia, who use
signs now. At the same time due consideration must be given to the great
change in the intercommunication of tribes, produced by the importation
of the horse, by which the habits of those Indians now, but not very
anciently, inhabiting the Plains were entirely changed. It is probable
that a sign language before existing became, contemporaneously with
nomadic life, cultivated and enriched.</p>

<p>As regards the Spanish origin suggested, there is ample evidence that
the Spaniards met signs in their early explorations north of and in the
northern parts of Mexico, and availed themselves of them but did not
introduce them. It is believed also that the elaborate picture writing
of Mexico was founded on gesture signs.</p>

<p>With reference to the statement that the Kaiowas are the most expert
sign talkers of the Plains, a&nbsp;number of authorities and
correspondents give the precedence to the Cheyennes, and an equal number
to the Arapahos. Probably the accident of meeting specially skillful
talkers in the several tribes visited influences such opinions.</p>

<p>The writer’s experience, both of the Utes and Pai-Utes, is different
from the above statement respecting the absence of signs among them.
They not only use their own signs but fully understand the difference
between the signs regarded as their own and those of the Kaiowas. On
special examination they understood some of the latter only as words of
a foreign language interpolated in an oral conversation would be
comprehended from the context, and others they would recognize as having
seen before among other tribes without adoption. The same is true
regarding the Brulé Sioux, as was clearly expressed by Medicine Bull,
their chief. The Pimas, Papagos, and Maricopas examined had a copious
sign language, yet were not familiar with many Kaiowa signs presented to
them.</p>

<p>Instead of referring to a time past when they did not use signs, the
Indians examined by the writer and by most of his correspondents speak
of a time when they and their fathers used it more freely and copiously
than at present, its disuse being from causes before mentioned. It,
however, may be true in some cases that a tribe, having been for a long
time in contact only with others the dialect of which was so nearly
<span class = "pagenum">319</span>
<a name = "page319" id = "page319"> </a>
akin as to be comprehensible, or from any reason being separated from
those of a strange speech, discontinued sign language for a time, and
then upon migration or forced removal came into circumstances where it
was useful, and revived it. It is asserted that some of the Muskoki and
the Ponkas now in the Indian Territory never saw sign language until
they arrived there. Yet there is some evidence that the Muskoki did use
signs a century ago, and some of the Ponkas still remaining on their old
homes on the Missouri remember it and have given their knowledge to an
accurate correspondent, Rev. J.&nbsp;O. Dorsey, though for many years
they have not been in circumstances to require its employment.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most salutary criticism to be offered regarding the
theory would be in the form of a query whether sign language has ever
been invented by any one body of people at any one time, and whether it
is not simply a phase in evolution, surviving and reviving when needed.
Criticism on this subject is made reluctantly, as it would be highly
interesting to determine that sign language on this continent came from
a particular stock, and to ascertain that stock. Such research would be
similar to that into the Aryan and Semitic sources to which many modern
languages have been traced backwards from existing varieties, and if
there appear to be existing varieties in signs their roots may still be
found to be <i>sui generis</i>. The possibility that the discrepancy
between signs was formerly greater than at present will receive
attention in discussing the distinction between the identity of signs
and their common use as an art. It is sufficient to add now that not
only does the burden of proof rest unfavorably upon the attempt to
establish one parent stock for sign language in North America, but it
also comes under the stigma now fastened upon the immemorial effort to
name and locate the original oral speech of man. It is only next in
difficulty to the old persistent determination to decide upon the origin
of the whole Indian “race,” in which most peoples of antiquity in the
eastern hemisphere, including the lost tribes of Israel, the Gipsies,
and the Welsh, have figured conspicuously as putative parents.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_theories_special" id = "sign_theories_special">
IS THE INDIAN SYSTEM SPECIAL AND PECULIAR?</a></h4>

<p>This inquiry is closely connected with the last. If the system of
signs was invented here in the correct sense of that term, and by a
known and existing tribe, it is probable that it would not be found
prevailing in any important degree where the influence of the inventors
could not readily have penetrated. An affirmative answer to the question
also presupposes the same answer to another question, viz, whether there
is any one uniform system among the North American Indians which can
therefore be compared with any other system. This last inquiry will be
considered in its order. In comparing the system as a whole with others,
the latter are naturally divided into signs of speaking men foreign to
America and those of deaf-mutes.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">320</span>
<a name = "page320" id = "page320"> </a>
<h5>COMPARISONS WITH FOREIGN SIGNS.</h5>

<p>The generalization of <span class = "smallcaps">Tylor</span> that
“gesture language is substantially the same among savage tribes all over
the world,” interpreted by his remarks in another connection, is
understood as referring to their common use of signs, and of signs
formed on the same principles, but not of precisely the same signs to
express the same ideas. In this sense of the generalization the result
of the writer’s study not only sustains it, but shows a surprising
number of signs for the same idea which are substantially identical, not
only among savage tribes, but among all peoples that use gesture signs
with any freedom. Men, in groping for a mode of communication with each
other, and using the same general methods, have been under many varying
conditions and circumstances which have determined differently many
conceptions and their semiotic execution, but there have also been many
of both which were similar. Our Indians have no special superstition
concerning the evil-eye like the Italians, nor have they been long
familiar with the jackass so as to make him emblematical of stupidity;
therefore signs for these concepts are not cisatlantic, but even in this
paper many are shown which are substantially in common between our
Indians and Italians. The large collection already obtained, but not now
published, shows many others identical, not only with those of the
Italians and the classic Greeks and Romans, but of other peoples of the
Old World, both savage and civilized. The generic uniformity is obvious,
while the occasion of specific varieties can be readily understood.</p>

<h5>COMPARISON WITH DEAF-MUTE SIGNS.</h5>

<p>The Indians who have been shown over the civilized East have often
succeeded in holding intercourse, by means of their invention and
application of principles in what may be called the voiceless mother
utterance, with white deaf-mutes, who surely have no semiotic code more
nearly connected with that attributed to the plain-roamers than is
derived from their common humanity. They showed the greatest pleasure in
meeting deaf-mutes, precisely as travelers in a foreign country are
rejoiced to meet persons speaking their language, with whom they can
hold direct communication without the tiresome and often suspected
medium of an interpreter. When they met together they were found to
pursue the same course as that noticed at the meeting of deaf-mutes who
were either not instructed in any methodical dialect or who had received
such instruction by different methods. They often disagreed in the signs
at first presented, but soon understood them, and finished by adopting
some in mutual compromise, which proved to be those most strikingly
appropriate, graceful, and convenient; but there still remained in some
cases a plurality of fitting signs for the same idea or object. On one
of the most interesting of these occasions, at the Pennsylvania
Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, in 1873, it was remarked that the
signs of the deaf-mutes were much more readily understood
<span class = "pagenum">321</span>
<a name = "page321" id = "page321"> </a>
by the Indians, who were Absaroka or Crows, Arapahos, and Cheyennes,
than were theirs by the deaf-mutes, and that the latter greatly excelled
in pantomimic effect. This need not be surprising when it is considered
that what is to the Indian a mere adjunct or accomplishment is to the
deaf-mute the natural mode of utterance, and that there is still greater
freedom from the trammel of translating words into action&mdash;instead
of acting the ideas themselves&mdash;when, the sound of words being
unknown, they remain still as they originated, but another kind of sign,
even after the art of reading is acquired, and do not become entities as
with us. The “action, action, action,” of Demosthenes is their only
oratory, not the mere heightening of it, however valuable.</p>

<p>On March 6, 1880, the writer had an interesting experience in taking
to the National Deaf-Mute College at Washington seven Utes (which tribe,
according to report, is unacquainted with sign language), among whom
were Augustin, Alejandro, Jakonik, Severio, and Wash. By the kind
attention of President <span class = "smallcaps">Gallaudet</span> a
thorough test was given, an equal number of deaf-mute pupils being
placed in communication with the Indians, alternating with them both in
making individual signs and in telling narratives in gesture, which were
afterwards interpreted in speech by the Ute interpreter and the officers
of the college. Notes of a few of them were taken, as follows:</p>

<p>Among the signs was that for <i>squirrel</i>, given by a deaf-mute.
The right hand was placed over and facing the left, and about four
inches above the latter, to show the height of the animal; then the two
hands were held edgewise and horizontally in front, about eight inches
apart (showing <i>length</i>); then imitating the grasping of a small
object and biting it rapidly with the incisors, the extended index was
pointed upward and forward (<i>in&nbsp;a tree</i>).</p>

<p>This was not understood, as the Utes have no sign for the tree
squirrel, the arboreal animal not being now found in their region.</p>

<p>Deaf-mute sign for <i>jack-rabbit</i>: The first two fingers of each
hand extended (the remaining fingers and thumbs closed) were placed on
either side of the head, pointing upward; then arching the hands, palm
down, quick, interrupted, jumping movements forward were made.</p>

<p>This was readily understood.</p>

<p>The signs for the following narrative were given by a deaf-mute: When
he was a boy he mounted a horse without either bridle or saddle, and as
the horse began to go he grasped him by the neck for support; a&nbsp;dog
flew at the horse, began to bark, when the rider was thrown off and
considerably hurt.</p>

<p>In this the sign for <i>dog</i> was as follows: Pass the arched hand
forward from the lower part of the face, to illustrate elongated nose
and mouth, then with both forefingers extended, remaining fingers and
thumbs closed, place them upon either side of the lower jaw, pointing
upward, to show lower canines, at the same time accompanying the gesture
with an expression of withdrawing the lips so as to show the teeth
snarling;
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322" id = "page322"> </a>
then, with the fingers of the right hand extended and separated throw
them quickly forward and slightly upward (<i>voice</i> or
<i>talking</i>).</p>

<p>This sign was understood to mean <i>bear</i>, as that for <i>dog</i>
is different among the Utes, <i>i.e.</i>, by merely showing the height
of the dog and pushing the flat hand forward, finger-tips first.</p>

<p>Another deaf-mute gestured to tell that when he was a boy he went to
a melon-field, tapped several melons, finding them to be green or
unripe; finally reaching a good one he took his knife, cut a slice, and
ate it. A&nbsp;man made his appearance on horseback, entered the patch
on foot, found the cut melon, and detecting the thief, threw the melon
towards him, hitting him in the back, whereupon he ran away crying. The
man mounted and rode off in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>All of these signs were readily comprehended, although some of the
Indians varied very slightly in their translation.</p>

<p>When the Indians were asked whether, if they (the deaf-mutes) were to
come to the Ute country they would be scalped, the answer was given,
“Nothing would be done to you; but we would be friends,” as follows:</p>

<p>The palm of the right hand was brushed toward the right over that of
the left (<i>nothing</i>), and the right hand made to grasp the palm of
the left, thumbs extended over and lying upon the back of the opposing
hand.</p>

<p>This was readily understood by the deaf-mutes.</p>

<p>Deaf-mute sign of milking a cow and drinking the milk was fully and
quickly understood.</p>

<p>The narrative of a boy going to an apple-tree, hunting for ripe fruit
and filling his pockets, being surprised by the owner and hit upon the
head with a stone, was much appreciated by the Indians and completely
understood.</p>

<p>A deaf-mute asked Alejandro how long it took him to come to
Washington from his country. He replied by placing the index and second
finger of the right hand astride the extended forefinger (others closed)
of the left; then elevating the fingers of the left hand (except thumb
and forefinger) back forward (<i>three</i>); then extending the fingers
of both hands and bringing them to a point, thumbs resting on palmar
sides and extended, placing the hands in front of the body, the tips
opposite the opposing wrist, and about four inches apart; then,
revolving them in imitation of <i>wheels</i>, he elevated the extended
forefinger of the left hand (<i>one</i>); then placing the extended flat
hands, thumbs touching, the backs sloping downward towards the
respective right and left sides, like the roof of a house; then
repeating the sign of wheels as in the preceding, after which the left
hand was extended before the body, fingers toward the right, horizontal,
palm down and slightly arched, the right wrist held under it, the
fingers extending upward beyond it, and quickly and repeatedly snapped
upward (<i>smoke</i>); the last three signs being
<i>covered</i>&mdash;<i>wagon</i>&mdash;<i>smoke</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>cars</i>; then elevating four fingers of the left hand
(<i>four</i>).</p>

<p><i>Translation.</i>&mdash;Traveled three days on horseback, one in a
wagon, and four in the cars.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<a name = "page323" id = "page323"> </a>
<p>The deaf-mutes understood all but the sign for wheel, which they make
as a large circle, with <i>one</i> hand.</p>

<p>Another example: A deaf-mute pretended to hunt something; found
birds, took his bow and arrows and killed several.</p>

<p>This was fully understood.</p>

<p>A narrative given by Alejandro was also understood by the deaf-mutes,
to the effect that he made search for deer, shot one with a gun, killed
and skinned it, and packed it up.</p>

<p>It will be observed that many of the above signs admitted of and were
expressed by pantomime, yet that was not the case with all that were
made. President <span class = "smallcaps">Gallaudet</span> made also
some remarks in gesture which were understood by the Indians, yet were
not strictly pantomimic.</p>

<p>The opinion of all present at the test was that two intelligent mimes
would seldom fail of mutual understanding, their attention being
exclusively directed to the expression of thoughts by the means of
comprehension and reply equally possessed by both, without the mental
confusion of conventional sounds only intelligible to one.</p>

<p>A large collection has been made of natural deaf-mute signs, and also
of those more conventional, which have been collated with those of the
several tribes of Indians. Many of them show marked similarity, not only
in principle but often in detail.</p>


<p class = "space">
The result of the studies so far as prosecuted is that what is called
<i>the</i> sign language of Indians is not, properly speaking, one
language, but that it and the gesture systems of deaf-mutes and of all
peoples constitute together one language&mdash;the gesture speech of
mankind&mdash;of which each system is a dialect.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_theories_prevalent" id = "sign_theories_prevalent">
TO WHAT EXTENT PREVALENT AS A SYSTEM.</a></h4>

<p>The assertion has been made by many writers, and is currently
repeated by Indian traders and some Army officers, that all the tribes
of North America have long had and still use a <i>common</i> and
<i>identical</i> sign language, in which they can communicate freely
without oral assistance. Although this remarkable statement is at
variance with some of the principles of the formation and use of signs
set forth by Dr. <span class = "smallcaps">E.&nbsp;B. Tylor</span>,
whose admirable chapters on gesture speech in his <i>Researches into the
Early History of Mankind</i> have in a great degree prompted the present
inquiries, that eminent authority did not see fit to discredit it. He
repeats the report as he received it, in the words that “the same signs
serve as a medium of converse from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico.”
Its truth or falsity can only be established by careful comparison of
lists or vocabularies of signs taken under test conditions at widely
different times and places. For this purpose lists have been collated by
the writer, taken in different parts of the country at several dates,
from the last century to the last month, comprising together several
thousand signs, many of them, however, being mere variants or
<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<a name = "page324" id = "page324"> </a>
synonyms for the same object or quality, some being repetitions of
others and some of small value from uncertainty in description or
authority, or both.</p>

<h5>ONCE PROBABLY UNIVERSAL IN NORTH AMERICA.</h5>

<p>The conclusion reached from the researches made is to the effect that
before the changes wrought by the Columbian discovery the use of gesture
illustrated the remark of Quintilian upon the same subject (l.&nbsp;xi,
c.&nbsp;3) that “<i>In tanta per omnes gentes nationesque linguæ
diversitate hic mihi omnium hominum communis sermo videatur.</i>”</p>

<p>Quotations may be taken from some old authorities referring to widely
separated regions. The Indians of Tampa Bay, identified with the
Timucua, met by Cabeça de Vaca in 1528, were active in the use of signs,
and in his journeying for eight subsequent years, probably through Texas
and Mexico, he remarks that he passed through many dissimilar tongues,
but that he questioned and received the answers of the Indians by signs
“just as if they spoke our language and we theirs.” Michaëlius, writing
in 1628, says of the Algonkins on or near the Hudson River: “For
purposes of trading as much was done by signs with the thumb and fingers
as by speaking.” In Bossu’s <i>Travels through that part of North
America formerly called Louisiana</i>, <i>London</i>, 1771 (Forster’s
translation), an account is given of Monsieur de Belle-Isle some years
previously captured by the Atak-apa, who remained with them two years
and “conversed in their pantomimes with them.” He was rescued by
Governor Bienville and was sufficiently expert in the sign language to
interpret between Bienville and the tribe. In Bushmann’s <i>Spuren</i>,
p.&nbsp;424, there is a reference to the “Accocessaws on the west side
of the Colorado, two hundred miles southwest of Nacogdoches,” who use
thumb signs which they understand: “<i>Theilen sich aber auch durch
Daum-Zeichen mit, die sie alle verstehen.</i>”</p>

<p>Omitting many authorities, and for brevity allowing a break in the
continuity of time, reference may be made to the statement in Major
Long’s expedition of 1819, concerning the Arapahos, Kaiowas, Ietans, and
Cheyennes, to the effect that, being ignorant of each other’s languages,
many of them when they met would communicate by means of signs, and
would thus maintain a conversation without the least difficulty or
interruption. A&nbsp;list of the tribes reported upon by Prince
Maximilian von Wied-Neuweid, in 1832-’34, appears elsewhere in this
paper. In Frémont’s expedition of 1844 special and repeated allusion is
made to the expertness of the Pai-Utes in signs, which is contradictory
to the statement above made by correspondents. The same is mentioned
regarding a band of Shoshonis met near the summit of the Sierra Nevada,
and one of “Diggers,” probably Chemehuevas, encountered on a tributary
of the Rio Virgen.</p>

<p>Ruxton, in his <i>Adventures in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains</i>,
<i>New York</i>, 1848, p.&nbsp;278, sums up his experience with regard
to the Western
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<a name = "page325" id = "page325"> </a>
tribes so well as to require quotation: “The language of signs is so
perfectly understood in the Western country, and the Indians themselves
are such admirable pantomimists, that, after a little use, no difficulty
whatever exists in carrying on a conversation by such a channel; and
there are few mountain men who are at a loss in thoroughly understanding
and making themselves intelligible by signs alone, although they neither
speak nor understand a word of the Indian tongue.”</p>

<p>Passing to the correspondents of the writer from remote parts of
North America, it is important to notice that Mr. J.&nbsp;W. Powell,
Indian superintendent, reports the use of sign language among the
Kutine, and Mr. James Lenihan, Indian agent, among the Selish, both
tribes of British Columbia. The Very Rev. Edward Jacker, while
contributing information upon the present use of gesture language among
the Ojibwas of Lake Superior, mentions that it has fallen into
comparative neglect because for three generations they had not been in
contact with tribes of a different speech. Dr. Francis H. Atkins, acting
assistant surgeon, United States Army, in forwarding a contribution of
signs of the Mescalero Apaches remarks: “I&nbsp;think it probable that
they have used sign language rather less than many other Indians. They
do not seem to use it to any extent at home, and abroad the only tribes
they were likely to come into contact with were the Navajos, the Lipans
of old Mexico, and the Comanches. Probably the last have been almost
alone their visiting neighbors. They have also seen the Pueblos a
little, these appearing to be, like the Phœnicians of old, the traders
of this region.” He also alludes to the effect of the Spanish, or rather
<i>lingua Mexicana</i>, upon all the Southern tribes and, indeed, upon
those as far north as the Utes, by which recourse to signs is now
rendered less necessary.</p>

<p>Before leaving this particular topic it is proper to admit that,
while there is not only recorded testimony to the past use of gesture
signs by several tribes of the Iroquoian and Algonkian families, but
evidence that it still remains, it is, however, noticeable that these
families when met by their first visitors do not appear to have often
impressed the latter with their reliance upon gesture language to the
same extent as has always been reported of the tribes now and formerly
found farther inland. An explanation may be suggested from the fact that
among those families there were more people dwelling near together in
communities speaking the same language, though with dialectic
peculiarities, than became known later in the farther West, and not
being nomadic their intercourse with strange tribes was less individual
and conversational. Some of the tribes, in especial the Iroquois proper,
were in a comparatively advanced social condition. A&nbsp;Mohawk or
Seneca would probably have repeated the arrogance of the old Romans,
whom in other respects they resembled, and compelled persons of inferior
tribes to learn his language if they desired to converse with him,
instead of resorting to the compromise of gesture speech, which he had
practiced before the prowess and policy of the confederated Five Nations
had gained supremacy and which was still used for special purposes
between the members of his own tribe.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">326</span>
<a name = "page326" id = "page326"> </a>
<p>The studies thus far pursued lead to the conclusion that at the time
of the discovery of North America all its inhabitants practiced sign
language, though with different degrees of expertness, and that while
under changed circumstances it was disused by some, others, in especial
those who after the acquisition of horses became nomads of the Great
Plains, retained and cultivated it to the high development now attained,
from which it will surely and speedily decay.</p>

<h5>MISTAKEN DENIAL THAT SIGN LANGUAGE EXISTS.</h5>

<p>The most useful suggestion to persons interested in the collection of
signs is that they shall not too readily abandon the attempt to discover
recollections of them even among tribes long exposed to European
influence and officially segregated from others. The instances where
their existence, at first denied, has been ascertained are important
with reference to the theories advanced.</p>

<p>Rev. J. Owen Dorsey has furnished a considerable vocabulary of signs
finally procured from the Poncas, although, after residing among them
for years, with thorough familiarity with their language, and after
special and intelligent exertion to obtain some of their disused gesture
language, he had before reported it to be entirely forgotten.
A&nbsp;similar report was made by two missionaries among the Ojibwas,
though other trustworthy authorities have furnished a copious list of
signs obtained from that tribe. This is no imputation against the
missionaries, as in October, 1880, five intelligent Ojibwas from
Petoskey, Mich., told the writer that they had never heard of gesture
language. An interesting letter from Mr. B.&nbsp;O. Williams, sr., of
Owasso, Mich., explains the gradual decadence of signs used by the
Ojibwas in his recollection, embracing sixty years, as chiefly arising
from general acquaintance with the English language. Further
discouragement came from an Indian agent giving the decided statement,
after four years of intercourse with the Pai-Utes, that no such thing as
a communication by signs was known or even remembered by them, which,
however, was less difficult to bear because on the day of the receipt of
that well-intentioned missive some officers of the Bureau of Ethnology
were actually talking in signs with a delegation of that very tribe of
Indians then in Washington, from one of whom, Nátci, a&nbsp;narrative
printed in this paper (page 500), was received.</p>

<p>The report from missionaries, army officers, and travelers in Alaska
was unanimous against the existence of a sign language there until Mr.
Ivan Petroff, whose explorations had been more extensive, gave the
excellent exposition and dialogue now produced (see page 492).
Collections were also obtained from the Apaches and Zuñi, Pimas,
Papagos, and Maricopas, after agents and travelers had denied them to be
possessed of any knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>For the reasons mentioned under the last heading, little hope was
entertained of procuring a collection from any of the Iroquoian stock,
but
<span class = "pagenum">327</span>
<a name = "page327" id = "page327"> </a>
the intelligent and respectable chief of the Wyandots, Hénto (Gray
Eyes), came to the rescue. His tribe was moved from Ohio in July, 1843,
to the territory now occupied by the State of Kansas, and then again
moved to Indian Territory, in 1870. He asserts that about one-third of
the tribe, the older portion, know many signs, a&nbsp;partial list of
which he gave with their descriptions. He was sure that those signs were
used before the removal from Ohio, and he saw them used also by
Shawnees, Delawares, and Senecas there.</p>

<p>Unanimous denial of any existence of sign language came from the
British provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and was followed by the
collection obtained by the Hon. Horatio Hale. His statement of the time
and manner of its being procured by him is not only interesting but
highly instructive:</p>

<p>“The aged Mohawk chief, from whom the information on this subject has
been obtained, is commonly known by his English name of John Smoke
Johnson. ‘Smoke’ is a rude version of his Indian name,
<i>Sakayenkwaraton</i>, which may be rendered ‘Disappearing Mist.’ It is
the term applied to the haze which rises in the morning of an autumn
day, and gradually passes away. Chief Johnson has been for many years
‘speaker’ of the great council of the Six Nations. In former times he
was noted as a warrior, and later has been esteemed one of the most
eloquent orators of his race. At the age of eighty-eight years he
retains much of his original energy. He is considered to have a better
knowledge of the traditions and ancient customs of his people than any
other person now living. This superior knowledge was strikingly apparent
in the course of the investigations which were made respecting the sign
language. Two other members of his tribe, well-educated and very
intelligent men of middle age, the one a chief and government
interpreter, the other a clergyman now settled over a white
congregation, had both been consulted on the subject and both expressed
the opinion that nothing of the sign language, properly speaking, was
known among the Six Nations. They were alike surprised and interested
when the old chief, in their presence, after much consideration,
gradually drew forth from the stores of his memory the proofs of an
accomplishment which had probably lain unused for more than half a
century.”</p>

<p>One of the most conclusive instances of the general knowledge of sign
language, even when seldom used, was shown in the visit of five
Jicarilla Apaches to Washington in April, 1880, under the charge of Dr.
Benjamin Thomas, their agent. The latter said he had never heard of any
use of signs among them. But it happened that there was a delegation of
Absaroka (Crows) at the same hotel, and the two parties from such widely
separated regions, not knowing a word of each other’s language,
immediately began to converse in signs, resulting in a decided
sensation. One of the Crows asked the Apaches whether they ate horses,
and it happening that the sign for <i>eating</i> was misapprehended for
that known by the Apaches for <i>many</i>, the question was supposed
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<a name = "page328" id = "page328"> </a>
to be whether the latter had many horses, which was answered in the
affirmative. Thence ensued a misunderstanding on the subject of
hippophagy, which was curious both as showing the general use of signs
as a practice and the diversity in special signs for particular
meanings. The surprise of the agent at the unsuspected accomplishment of
his charges was not unlike that of a hen who, having hatched a number of
duck eggs, is perplexed at the instinct with which the brood takes to
the water.</p>

<p>The denial of the use of signs is often faithfully though erroneously
reported from the distinct statements of Indians to that effect. In
that, as in other matters, they are often provokingly reticent about
their old habits and traditions. Chief Ouray asserted to the writer, as
he also did to Colonel Dodge, that his people, the Utes, had not the
practice of sign talk, and had no use for it. This was much in the proud
spirit in which an Englishman would have made the same statement, as the
idea involved an accusation against the civilization of his people,
which he wished to appear highly advanced. Still more frequently the
Indians do not distinctly comprehend what is sought to be obtained.
Sometimes, also, the art, abandoned in general, only remains in the
memories of a few persons influenced by special circumstances or
individual fancy.</p>

<p>In this latter regard a comparison may be made with the old science
of heraldry, once of practical use and a necessary part of a liberal
education, of which hardly a score of persons in the United States have
any but the vague knowledge that it once existed; yet the united
memories of those persons could, in the absence of records, reproduce
all essential points on the subject.</p>

<p>Another cause for the mistaken denial in question must be mentioned.
When travelers or sojourners have become acquainted with signs in any
one place they may assume that those signs constitute <i>the</i> sign
language, and if they afterwards meet tribes not at once recognizing
those signs, they remove all difficulty about the theory of a “one and
indivisible” sign language by simply asserting that the tribes so met do
not understand <i>the</i> sign language, or perhaps that they do not use
signs at all. This precise assertion has, as above mentioned, been made
regarding the Utes and Apaches. Of course, also, Indians who have not
been brought into sufficient contact with certain tribes using different
signs, for the actual trial which would probably result in mutual
comprehension, tell the travelers the same story. It is the venerable
one of “<span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"aglôssos">ἄγλωσσος</span>,” “Njemez,” “barbarian,” and “stammering,”
above noted, applied to the hands instead of the tongue. Thus an
observer possessed by a restrictive theory will find no signs where they
are in plenty, while another determined on the universality and identity
of sign language can, as elsewhere explained, produce, from perhaps the
same individuals, evidence in his favor from the apparently conclusive
result of successful communication.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329" id = "page329"> </a>
<h5>PERMANENCE OF SIGNS.</h5>

<p>In connection with any theory it is important to inquire into the
permanence of particular gesture signs to express a special idea or
object when the system has been long continued. Many examples have been
given above showing that the gestures of classic times are still in use
by the modern Italians with the same signification; indeed that the
former on Greek vases or reliefs or in Herculanean bronzes can only be
interpreted by the latter. In regard to the signs of instructed
deaf-mutes in this country there appears to be a permanence beyond
expectation. Mr. Edmund Booth, a&nbsp;pupil of the Hartford Institute
half a century ago, and afterwards a teacher, says in the
“<i>Annals</i>” for April, 1880, that the signs used by teachers and
pupils at Hartford, Philadelphia, Washington, Council Bluffs, and Omaha
were nearly the same as he had learned. “We still adhere to the old sign
for President from Monroe’s three-cornered hat, and for governor we
designate the cockade worn by that dignitary on grand occasions three
generations ago.”</p>

<p>The specific comparisons made, especially by Dr. Washington Matthews
and Dr. W.&nbsp;C. Boteler, of the signs reported by the Prince of Wied
in 1832 with those now used by the same tribes from whom he obtained
them, show a remarkable degree of permanency in many of those that were
so clearly described by the Prince as to be proper subjects of any
comparison. If they have persisted for half a century their age is
probably much greater. In general it is believed that signs,
constituting as they do a natural mode of expression, though enlarging
in scope as new ideas and new objects require to be included and though
abbreviated as hereinafter explained, do not readily change in their
essentials.</p>

<p>The writer has before been careful to explain that he does not
present any signs as precisely those of primitive man, not being so
carried away by enthusiasm as to suppose them possessed of immutability
and immortality not found in any other mode of human utterance. Yet such
signs as are generally prevalent among Indian tribes, and also in other
parts of the world, must be of great antiquity. The use of derivative
meanings to a sign only enhances this presumption. At first there might
not appear to be any connection between the ideas of <i>same</i> and
<i>wife</i>, expressed by the sign of horizontally extending the two
forefingers side by side. The original idea was doubtless that given by
the Welsh captain in Shakspere’s Henry&nbsp;V: “’Tis so like as my
fingers is to my fingers,” and from this similarity comes “equal,”
“companion,” and subsequently the close life-companion “wife.” The sign
is used in each of these senses by different Indian tribes, and
sometimes the same tribe applies it in all of the senses as the context
determines. It appears also in many lands with all the significations
except that of “wife.” It is proper here to mention that the suggestion
of several correspondents that the Indian sign as applied to “wife”
refers to “lying together” is rendered improbable by the fact that when
the same tribes desire to express the sexual relation of marriage it is
gestured otherwise.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330" id = "page330"> </a>
<p>Many signs but little differentiated were unstable, while others that
have proved the best modes of expression have survived as definite and
established. Their prevalence and permanence being mainly determined by
the experience of their utility, it would be highly interesting to
ascertain how long a time was required for a distinctly new conception
or execution to gain currency, become “the fashion,” so to speak, over a
large part of the continent, and to be supplanted by a new “mode.”
A&nbsp;note may be made in this connection of the large number of
diverse signs for <i>horse</i>, all of which must have been invented
within a comparatively recent period, and the small variation in the
signs for <i>dog</i>, which are probably ancient.</p>

<h5>SURVIVAL IN GESTURE.</h5>

<p>Even when the specific practice of sign language has been generally
discontinued for more than one generation, either from the adoption of a
jargon or from the common use of the tongue of the conquering English,
French, or Spanish, some of the gestures formerly employed as
substitutes for words may survive as a customary accompaniment to
oratory or impassioned conversation, and, when ascertained, should be
carefully noted. An example, among many, may be found in the fact that
the now civilized Muskoki or Creeks, as mentioned by Rev. H.&nbsp;F.
Buckner, when speaking of the height of children or women, illustrate
their words by holding their hands at the proper elevation, palm up; but
when describing the height of “soulless” animals or inanimate objects,
they hold the palm downward. This, when correlated with the distinctive
signs of other Indians, is an interesting case of the survival of a
practice which, so far as yet reported, the oldest men of the tribe, now
living only remember to have once existed. It is probable that a
collection of such distinctive gestures among the most civilized Indians
would reproduce enough of their ancient system to be valuable, while
possibly the persistent inquirer might in his search discover some of
its surviving custodians even among Chabta or Cheroki, Innuit or Abnaki,
Klamath or Nutka.</p>

<h5>DISTINCTION BETWEEN IDENTITY OF SIGNS AND THEIR USE AS AN ART.</h5>

<p>The general report that there is but one sign language in North
America, any deviation from which is either blunder, corruption, or a
dialect in the nature of provincialism, may be examined in reference to
some of the misconceived facts which gave it origin and credence. It may
not appear to be necessary that such examination should be directed to
any mode of collecting and comparing signs which would amount to their
distortion. It is useful, however, to explain that distortion would
result from following the views of a recent essayist, who takes the
ground that the description of signs should be made according to a
“mean” or average. There can be no philosophic consideration of signs
according to a “mean” of observations. The proper object is to ascertain
the radical or essential part
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<a name = "page331" id = "page331"> </a>
as distinct from any individual flourish or mannerism on the one hand,
and from a conventional or accidental abbreviation on the other; but a
mere average will not accomplish that object. If the hand, being in any
position whatever, is, according to five observations, moved
horizontally one foot to the right, and, according to five other
observations, moved one foot horizontally to the left, the “mean” or
resultant will be that it is stationary, which sign does not correspond
with any of the ten observations. So if six observations give it a rapid
motion of one foot to the right and five a rapid motion of the same
distance to the left, the mean or resultant would be somewhat difficult
to express, but perhaps would be a slow movement to the right for an
inch or two, having certainly no resemblance either in essentials or
accidents to any of the signs actually observed. In like manner the tail
of the written letter “<i>y</i>” (which, regarding its mere formation,
might be a graphic sign) may have in the chirography of several persons
various degrees of slope, may be a straight line, or looped, and may be
curved on either side; but a “mean” taken from the several manuscripts
would leave the unfortunate letter without any tail whatever, or
travestied as a “<i>u</i>” with an amorphous flourish. A&nbsp;definition
of the radical form of the letter or sign by which it can be
distinguished from any other letter or sign is a very different
proceeding. Therefore, if a “mean” or resultant of any number of
radically different signs to express the same object or idea, observed
either among several individuals of the same tribe or among different
tribes, is made to represent those signs, they are all mutilated and
ignored as distinctive signs, though the result may possibly be made
intelligible in practice, according to principles mentioned in the
present paper. The expedient of a “mean” may be practically useful in
the formation of a mere interpreter’s jargon, but it elucidates no
principle. It is also convenient for any one determined to argue for the
uniformity of sign language as against the variety in unity apparent in
all the realms of nature. On the “mean” principle, he only needs to take
his two-foot rule and arithmetical tables and make all signs his signs
and his signs all signs. Of course they are uniform, because he has made
them so after the brutal example of Procrustes.</p>

<p>In this connection it is proper to urge a warning that a mere sign
talker is often a bad authority upon principles and theories. He may not
be liable to the satirical compliment of Dickens’s “brave courier,” who
“understood all languages indifferently ill”; but many men speak some
one language fluently, and yet are wholly unable to explain or analyze
its words and forms so as to teach it to another person, or even to give
an intelligent summary or classification of their own knowledge. What
such a sign talker has learned is by memorizing, as a child may learn
English, and though both the sign talker and the child may be able to
give some separate items useful to a philologist or foreigner, such
items are spoiled when colored by the attempt of ignorance to theorize.

A German who has studied English to thorough mastery, except in the mere
facility of speech, may in a discussion upon some of its principles be
contradicted by any mere English speaker, who insists upon his superior
knowledge because he actually speaks the language and his antagonist
does not, but the student will probably be correct and the talker wrong.
It is an old adage about oral speech that a man who understands but one
language understands none. The science of a sign talker possessed by a
restrictive theory is like that of Mirabeau, who was greater as an
orator than as a philologist, and who on a visit to England gravely
argued that there was something seriously wrong in the British mind
because the people would persist in saying “give me some bread” instead
of “<i>donnez-moi du pain</i>,” which was so much easier and more
natural. A&nbsp;designedly ludicrous instance to the same effect was
Hood’s arraignment of the French because they called their mothers
“mares” and their daughters “fillies.” It is necessary to take with
caution any statement from a person who, having memorized or hashed up
any number of signs, large or small, has decided in his conceit that
those he uses are the only genuine Simon Pure, to be exclusively
employed according to his direction, all others being counterfeits or
blunders. His vocabulary has ceased to give the signs of any Indian or
body of Indians whatever, but becomes his own, the proprietorship of
which he fights for as if secured by letters-patent. When a sign is
contributed by one of the present collaborators, which such a sign
talker has not before seen or heard of, he will at once condemn it as
bad, just as a United States Minister to Vienna, who had been nursed in
the mongrel Dutch of Berks County, Pennsylvania, declared that the
people of Germany spoke very bad German.</p>

<p>An argument for the uniformity of the signs of our Indians is derived
from the fact that those used by any of them are generally understood by
others. But signs may be understood without being identical with any
before seen. The entribal as well as intertribal exercise of Indians for
generations in gesture language has naturally produced great skill both
in expression and reception, so as to render them measurably independent
of any prior mutual understanding, or what in a system of signals is
called preconcert. Two accomplished army signalists can, after
sufficient trial, communicate without having any code in common between
them, one being mutually devised, and those specially designed for
secrecy are often deciphered. So, if any one of the more conventional
signs is not quickly comprehended, an Indian skilled in the principle of
signs resorts to another expression of his flexible art, perhaps
reproducing the gesture unabbreviated and made more graphic, perhaps
presenting either the same or another conception or quality of the same
object or idea by an original portraiture.</p>

<p>An impression of the community of signs is the more readily made
because explorers and officials are naturally brought into contact more
closely with those individuals of the tribes visited who are experts in
<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<a name = "page333" id = "page333"> </a>
sign language than with their other members, and those experts, on
account of their skill as interpreters, are selected as guides to
accompany the visitors. The latter also seek occasion to be present when
signs are used, whether with or without words, in intertribal councils,
and then the same class of experts comprises the orators, for long
exercise in gesture speech has made the Indian politicians, with no
special effort, masters of the art acquired by our public speakers only
after laborious apprenticeship. The whole theory and practice of sign
language being that all who understand its principles can make
themselves mutually intelligible, the fact of the ready comprehension
and response among all the skilled gesturers gives the impression of a
common code. Furthermore, if the explorer learn to employ with ingenuity
the signs used by any of the tribes, he will probably be understood in
any other by the same class of persons who will surround him in the
latter, thereby confirming him in the “common” theory. Those of the
tribe who are less skilled, but who are not noticed, might be unable to
catch the meaning of signs which have not been actually taught to them,
just as ignorant persons among us cannot derive any sense from
newly-coined words or those strange to their habitual vocabulary, which,
though never before heard, linguistic scholars would instantly
understand and might afterward adopt.</p>

<p>It is also common experience that when Indians find that a sign which
has become conventional among their tribe is not understood by an
interlocutor, a&nbsp;self-expressive sign is substituted for it, from
which a visitor may form the impression that there are no conventional
signs. It may likewise occur that the self-expressive sign substituted
will be met with by a visitor in several localities, different Indians,
in their ingenuity, taking the best and the same means of reaching the
exotic intelligence.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that where sign language is now found among
Indian tribes it has become more uniform than ever before, simply
because many tribes have for some time past been forced to dwell near
together at peace. A&nbsp;collection was obtained in the spring of 1880,
at Washington, from a united delegation of the Kaiowa, Comanche, Apache,
and Wichita tribes, which was nearly uniform, but the individuals who
gave the signs had actually lived together at or near Anadarko, Indian
Territory, for a considerable time, and the resulting uniformity of
their signs might either be considered as a jargon or as the natural
tendency to a compromise for mutual understanding&mdash;the unification
so often observed in oral speech, coming under many circumstances out of
former heterogeneity. The rule is that dialects precede languages and
that out of many dialects comes one language. It may be found that other
individuals of those same tribes who have from any cause not lived in
the union explained may have signs for the same ideas different from
those in the collection above mentioned. This is probable, because some
signs of other representatives of one of the component
bodies&mdash;Apache&mdash;have actually been reported differing from
those for the same ideas given by
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<a name = "page334" id = "page334"> </a>
the Anadarko group. The uniformity of the signs of those Arapahos,
Cheyennes, and Sioux who have been secluded for years at one particular
reservation, so far as could be done by governmental power, from the
outer world, was used in argument by a correspondent; but some collected
signs of other Cheyennes and Sioux differ, not only from those on the
reservation, but among each other. Therefore the signs used in common by
the tribes at the reservation seem to have been modified and to a
certain extent unified.</p>

<p>The result of the collation and analysis of the large number of signs
collected is that in numerous instances there is an entire discrepancy
between the signs made by different bodies of Indians to express the
same idea, and that if any of these are regarded as rigidly determinate,
or even conventional with a limited range, and used without further
devices, they will fail in conveying the desired impression to any one
unskilled in gesture as an art, who had not formed the same precise
conception or been instructed in the arbitrary motion. Few of the
gestures that are found in current use are, in their origin,
conventional. They are only portions, more or less elaborate, of obvious
natural pantomime, and those proving efficient to convey most
successfully at any time the several ideas became the most widely
adopted, liable, however, to be superseded by more appropriate
conceptions and delineations. The skill of any tribe and the copiousness
of its signs are proportioned first to the necessity for their use, and
secondly to the accidental ability of the individuals in it who act as
custodians and teachers, so that the several tribes at different times
vary in their degree of proficiency, and therefore both the precise mode
of semiotic expression and the amount of its general use are always
fluctuating. Sign language as a product of evolution has been developed
rather than invented, and yet it seems probable that each of the
separate signs, like the several steps that lead to any true invention,
had a definite origin arising out of some appropriate occasion, and the
same sign may in this manner have had many independent origins due to
identity in the circumstances, or if lost, may have been reproduced.</p>

<p>The process is precisely the same as that observed among deaf-mutes.
One of those unfortunate persons, living with his speaking relatives,
may invent signs which the latter are taught to understand, though
strangers sometimes will not, because they may be by no means the
fittest expressions. Should a dozen or more deaf-mutes, possessed only
of such crude signs, come together, they will be able at first to
communicate only on a few common subjects, but the number of those and
the general scope of expression will be continually enlarged. Each one
commences with his own conception and his own presentment of it, but the
universality of the medium used makes it sooner or later understood.
This independent development, thus creating diversity, often renders the
first interchange of thought between strangers slow, for the signs must
be self-interpreting. There can be no natural universal language which
is absolute and arbitrary. When used without convention, as sign
language
<span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<a name = "page335" id = "page335"> </a>
alone of all modes of utterance can be, it must be tentative,
experimental, and flexible. The mutes will also resort to the invention
of new signs for new ideas as they arise, which will be made
intelligible, if necessary, through the illustration and definition
given by signs formerly adopted, so that the fittest signs will be
evolved, after rivalry and trial, and will survive. But there may not
always be such a preponderance of fitness that all but one of the rival
signs shall die out, and some, being equal in value to express the same
idea or object, will continue to be used indifferently, or as a matter
of individual taste, without confusion. A&nbsp;multiplication of the
numbers confined together, either of deaf-mutes or of Indians whose
speech is diverse, will not decrease the resulting uniformity, though it
will increase both the copiousness and the precision of the vocabulary.
The Indian use of signs, though maintained by linguistic diversities, is
not coincident with any linguistic boundaries. The tendency is to their
uniformity among groups of people who from any cause are brought into
contact with each other while still speaking different languages. The
longer and closer such contact, while no common tongue is adopted, the
greater will be the uniformity of signs.</p>

<p>Colonel Dodge takes a middle ground with regard to the identity of
the signs used by our Indians, comparing it with the dialects and
provincialisms of the English language, as spoken in England, Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales. But those dialects are the remains of actually
diverse languages, which to some speakers have not become integrated. In
England alone the provincial dialects are traceable as the legacies of
Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Danes, with a varying amount of Norman
influence. A&nbsp;thorough scholar in the composite tongue, now called
English, will be able to understand all the dialects and provincialisms
of English in the British Isles, but the uneducated man of Yorkshire is
not able to communicate readily with the equally uneducated man of
Somersetshire. This is the true distinction to be made. A&nbsp;thorough
sign talker would be able to talk with several Indians who have no signs
in common, and who, if their knowledge of signs were only memorized,
could not communicate together. So also, as an educated Englishman will
understand the attempts of a foreigner to speak in very imperfect and
broken English, a&nbsp;good Indian sign expert will apprehend the feeble
efforts of a tyro in gestures. But Colonel Dodge’s conclusion that there
is but one true Indian sign language, just as there is but one true
English language, is not proved unless it can be shown that a much
larger proportion of the Indians who use signs at all, than present
researches show to be the case, use identically the same signs to
express the same ideas. It would also seem necessary to the parallel
that the signs so used should be absolute, if not arbitrary, as are the
words of an oral language, and not independent of preconcert and
self-interpreting at the instant of their invention or first exhibition,
as all true signs must originally have been and still measurably remain.
All Indians, as all gesturing men, have many natural signs in common and
many others which are now conventional. The conventions
<span class = "pagenum">336</span>
<a name = "page336" id = "page336"> </a>
by which the latter were established occurred during long periods, when
the tribes forming them were so separated as to have established
altogether diverse customs and mythologies, and when the several tribes
were with such different environment as to have formed varying
conceptions needing appropriate sign expression. The old error that the
North American Indians constitute one homogeneous race is now abandoned.
Nearly all the characteristics once alleged as segregating them from the
rest of mankind have proved not to belong to the whole of the
pre-Columbian population, but only to those portions of it first
explored. The practice of scalping is not now universal, even among the
tribes least influenced by civilization, if it ever was, and therefore
the cultivation of the scalp-lock separated from the rest of the hair of
the head, or with the removal of all other hair, is not a general
feature of their appearance. The arrangement of the hair is so different
among tribes as to be one of the most convenient modes for their
pictorial distinction. The war paint, red in some tribes, was black in
others; the mystic rites of the calumet were in many regions unknown,
and the use of wampum was by no means extensive. The wigwam is not the
type of native dwellings, which show as many differing forms as those of
Europe. In color there is great variety, and even admitting that the
term “race” is properly applied, no competent observer would
characterize it as red, still less copper-colored. Some tribes differ
from each other in all respects nearly as much as either of them do from
the lazzaroni of Naples, and more than either do from certain tribes of
Australia. It would therefore be expected, as appears to be the case,
that the conventional signs of different stocks and regions differ as do
the words of English, French, and German, which, nevertheless, have
sprung from the same linguistic roots. No one of those languages is a
dialect of any of the others; and although the sign systems of the
several tribes have greater generic unity with less specific variety
than oral languages, no one of them is necessarily the dialect of any
other.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of admitting, with present knowledge, that the
signs of our Indians are “identical” and “universal,” it is the more
accurate statement that the systematic attempt to convey meaning by
signs is universal among the Indians of the Plains, and those still
comparatively unchanged by civilization. Its successful execution is by
an <i>art</i>, which, however it may have commenced as an instinctive
mental process, has been cultivated, and consists in actually pointing
out objects in sight not only for designation, but for application and
predication, and in suggesting others to the mind by action and the airy
forms produced by action. To insist that sign language is uniform were
to assert that it is perfect&mdash;“That faultless monster that the
world ne’er saw.”</p>

<h5>FORCED AND MISTAKEN SIGNS.</h5>

<p>Examination into the identity of signs is complicated by the fact
that in the collection and description of Indian signs there is danger
lest the
<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<a name = "page337" id = "page337"> </a>
civilized understanding of them may be mistaken or forced. The liability
to those errors is much increased when the collections are not taken
directly from the Indians themselves, but are given as obtained at
second-hand from white traders, trappers, and interpreters, who, through
misconception in the beginning and their own introduction or
modification of gestures, have produced a jargon in the sign, as well as
in the oral intercourse. An Indian talking in signs, either to a white
man or to another Indian using signs which he never saw before, catches
the meaning of that which is presented and adapts himself to it, at
least for the occasion. Even when he finds that his interlocutor insists
upon understanding and presenting a certain sign in a manner and with a
significance widely different from those to which he has been
accustomed, it is within the very nature, tentative and elastic, of the
gesture art&mdash;both performers being on an equality&mdash;that he
should adopt the one that seems to be recognized or that is pressed upon
him, as with much greater difficulty he has learned and adopted many
foreign terms used with whites before attempting to acquire their
language, but never with his own race. Thus there is now, and perhaps
always has been, what may be called a <i>lingua-franca</i>, in the sign
vocabulary. It is well known that all the tribes of the Plains having
learned by experience that white visitors expect to receive certain
signs really originating with the latter, use them in their intercourse
just as they sometimes do the words “squaw” and “papoose,” corruptions
of the Algonkian, and once as meaningless in the present West as the
English terms “woman” and “child,” but which the first pioneers, having
learned them on the Atlantic coast, insisted upon treating as generally
intelligible.</p>

<p>The perversity in attaching through preconceived views a wrong
significance to signs is illustrated by an anecdote found in several
versions and in several languages, but repeated as a veritable Scotch
legend by Duncan Anderson, esq., Principal of the Glasgow Institution
for the Deaf and Dumb, when he visited Washington in 1853.</p>

<p>King James I. of England, desiring to play a trick upon the Spanish
ambassador, a&nbsp;man of great erudition, but who had a crotchet in his
head upon sign language, informed him that there was a distinguished
professor of that science in the university at Aberdeen. The ambassador
set out for that place, preceded by a letter from the King with
instructions to make the best of him. There was in the town one Geordy,
a&nbsp;butcher, blind of one eye, a&nbsp;fellow of much wit and
drollery. Geordy is told to play the part of a professor, with the
warning not to speak a word; is gowned, wigged, and placed in a chair of
state, when the ambassador is shown in and they are left alone together.
Presently the nobleman came out greatly pleased with the experiment,
claiming that his theory was demonstrated. He said: “When I entered the
room I raised one finger to signify there is one God. He replied by
raising two fingers to signify that this Being rules over two worlds,
the material and the spiritual. Then I raised three fingers, to say
there are three
<span class = "pagenum">338</span>
<a name = "page338" id = "page338"> </a>
persons in the Godhead. He then closed his fingers, evidently to say
these three are one.” After this explanation on the part of the nobleman
the professors sent for the butcher and asked him what took place in the
recitation room. He appeared very angry and said: “When the crazy man
entered the room where I was he raised one finger, as much as to say I
had but one eye, and I raised two fingers to signify that I could see
out of my one eye as well as he could out of both of his. When he raised
three fingers, as much as to say there were but three eyes between us,
I&nbsp;doubled up my fist, and if he had not gone out of that room in a
hurry I would have knocked him down.”</p>

<p>The readiness with which a significance may be found in signs when
none whatever exists is also shown in the great contest narrated by
Rabelais between Panurge and the English philosopher, Thaumast,
commencing as follows:</p>

<p>“Everybody then taking heed in great silence, the Englishman lifted
his two hands separately, clinching the ends of his fingers in the form
that at Chion they call the fowl’s tail. Then he struck them together by
the nails four times. Then he opened them and struck one flat upon the
other with a clash once; after which, joining them as above, he struck
twice, and four times afterwards, on opening them. Then he placed them,
joined and extended the one above the other, seeming to pray God
devoutly.</p>

<p>“Panurge suddenly moved his right hand in the air, placed the
right-hand thumb at the right-hand nostril, holding the four fingers
stretched out and arrayed in parallel lines with the point of the nose;
shutting the left eye entirely, and winking with the right, making a
profound depression with eyebrow and eyelid. Next he raised aloft the
left with a strong clinching and extension of the four fingers and
elevation of the thumb, and held it in line directly corresponding with
the position of the right, the distance between the two being a cubit
and a half. This done, in the like manner he lowered towards the ground
both hands, and finally held them in the midst as if aiming straight at
the Englishman’s nose.”</p>

<p>And so on at great length. The whole performance of Panurge was to
save the credit of Pantagruel by making fantastic and mystic motions in
pretended disputation with the signs given by Thaumast in good faith.
Yet the latter confessed himself conquered, and declared that he had
derived inestimable information from the purposely meaningless gestures.
The satire upon the diverse interpretations of the gestures of
Naz-de-cabre (<i>Pantagruel</i>, Book III, chap.&nbsp;xx) is to the same
effect, showing it to have been a favorite theme with Rabelais.</p>

<h5>ABBREVIATIONS.</h5>

<p>A lesson was learned by the writer as to the abbreviation of signs,
and the possibility of discovering the original meaning of those most
obscure, from the attempts of a Cheyenne to convey the idea of <i>old
man</i>.
<span class = "pagenum">339</span>
<a name = "page339" id = "page339"> </a>
He held his right hand forward, bent at elbow, fingers and thumb closed
sidewise. This not conveying any sense, he found a long stick, bent his
back, and supported his frame in a tottering step by the stick held, as
was before only imagined. Here at once was decrepit age dependent on a
staff. The principle of abbreviation or reduction may be illustrated by
supposing a person, under circumstances forbidding the use of the voice,
seeking to call attention to a particular bird on a tree, and failing to
do so by mere indication. Descriptive signs are resorted to, perhaps
suggesting the bill and wings of the bird, its manner of clinging to the
twig with its feet, its size by seeming to hold it between the hands,
its color by pointing to objects of the same hue; perhaps by the action
of shooting into a tree, picking up the supposed fallen game, and
plucking feathers. These are continued until understood, and if one sign
or combination of signs proves to be successful it will be repeated on
the next occasion by both persons engaged, and after becoming familiar
between them and others will be more and more abbreviated.
Conventionality in signs largely consists in the form of abbreviation
which is agreed upon. When the signs of the Indians have from
ideographic form thus become demotic, they may be called conventional,
but still not arbitrary. In them, as in all his actions, man had at the
first a definite meaning or purpose, together with method in their
subsequent changes or modifications.</p>

<p>Colonel Dodge gives a clear account of the manner in which an
established sign is abbreviated in practice, as follows: “There are an
almost infinite number and variety of abbreviations. For instance, to
tell a man to ‘talk,’ the most common formal sign is made thus: Hold the
right hand in front of, the back near, the mouth, end of thumb and
index-finger joined into an ‘O,’ the outer fingers closed on the palm;
throw the hand forward sharply by a quick motion of the wrist, and at
the same time flip forward the index-finger. This may be done once or
several times.</p>

<p>“The formal sign to ‘cease’ or ‘stop doing’ anything is made by
bringing the two hands open and held vertically in front of the body,
one behind the other, then quickly pass one upward, the other downward,
simulating somewhat the motion of the limbs of a pair of scissors,
meaning ‘cut it off.’ The latter sign is made in conversation in a
variety of ways, but habitually with one hand only.</p>

<p>“The formal sign to ‘stop talking’ is first to make the formal sign
for ‘talk,’ then the formal sign for ‘cut;’ but this is commonly
abbreviated by first making the formal sign for ‘talk’ with the right
hand, and then immediately passing the same hand, open, fingers
extended, downward across and in front of the mouth, ‘talk, cut.’</p>

<p>“But though the Plains Indian, if asked for the sign to ‘stop
talking,’ will properly give the sign either in its extended or
abbreviated form as above, he in conversation abbreviates it so much
further that the sign loses almost all resemblance to its former self.
Whatever the position of the hand, a&nbsp;turn of the wrist, a&nbsp;flip
of the forefinger, and a
<span class = "pagenum">340</span>
<a name = "page340" id = "page340"> </a>
turn of the wrist back to its original position is fully equivalent to
the elaborate signs.”</p>

<p>It may be added that nearly every sign which to be intelligibly
described and as exhibited in full requires the use of both hands, is
outlined, with one hand only, by skillful Indians gesturing between
themselves, so as to be clearly understood between them. Two Indians,
whose blankets are closely held to their bodies by the left hand, which
is necessarily rendered unavailable for gesture, will severally thrust
the right from beneath the protecting folds and converse freely. The
same is true when one hand of each holds the bridle of a horse.</p>

<p>The Italian signs are also made in such abbreviated forms as to be
little more than hinted at, requiring a perfect knowledge of the full
and original form before the slight and often furtive suggestion of it
can be understood. Deaf-mutes continually seek by tacit agreement to
shorten their signs more and more. While the original of each may be
preserved in root or stem, it is only known to the proficient, as the
root or stem of a plant enables botanists, but no others, to distinguish
it. Thus the natural character of signs, the universal significance
which is their peculiarly distinctive feature, may and often does become
lost. From the operation of the principle of independent and individual
abbreviation inherent in all sign language, without any other cause,
that of the Indians must in one or two generations have become diverse,
even if it had in fact originated from one tribe in which all
conceptions and executions were absolute.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_theories_conventional" id =
"sign_theories_conventional">
ARE SIGNS CONVENTIONAL OR INSTINCTIVE?</a></h4>

<p>There has been much discussion on the question whether gesture signs
were originally invented, in the strict sense of that term, or whether
they result from a natural connection between them and the ideas
represented by them, that is whether they are conventional or
instinctive. Cardinal Wiseman (<i>Essays</i>, III, 537) thinks that they
are of both characters; but referring particularly to the Italian signs
and the proper mode of discovering their meaning, observes that they are
used primarily with words and from the usual accompaniment of certain
phrases. “For these the gestures become substitutes, and then by
association express all their meaning, even when used alone.” This would
be the process only where systematic gestures had never prevailed or had
been so disused as to be forgotten, and were adopted after elaborate
oral phrases and traditional oral expressions had become common. In
other parts of this paper it is suggested that conventionality chiefly
consists in abbreviation, and that signs are originally
self-interpreting, independent of words, and therefore in a certain
sense instinctive.</p>

<p>Another form of the above query, having the same intent, is whether
signs are arbitrary or natural. The answer will depend upon what the
observer considers to be natural to himself. A&nbsp;common sign among
both deaf-mutes and Indians for <i>woman</i> consists in designating the
<span class = "pagenum">341</span>
<a name = "page341" id = "page341"> </a>
arrangement of the hair, but such a represented arrangement of hair
familiar to the gesturer as had never been seen by the person addressed
would not seem “natural” to the latter. It would be classed as
arbitrary, and could not be understood without context or explanation,
indeed without translation such as is required from foreign oral speech.
Signs most naturally, that is, appropriately, expressing a conception of
the thing signified, are first adopted and afterwards modified by
circumstances of environment, so as to appear, without full
understanding, conventional and arbitrary, yet they are as truly
“natural” as the signs for hearing, seeing, eating, and drinking, which
continue all over the world as they were first formed because there is
no change in those operations.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_theories_diversities" id =

CLASSES OF DIVERSITIES IN SIGNS.</a></h4>

<p>While there is not sufficient evidence that any exhibition of sign
language in any tribe is a dialect derived or corrupted from an
ascertained language in any other tribe, it still is convenient to
consider the different forms appearing in different tribes as several
dialects (in&nbsp;the usual mode of using that term) of a common
language. Every sign talker necessarily has, to some extent,
a&nbsp;dialect of his own. No one can use sign language without original
invention and without modification of the inventions of others; and all
such new inventions and modifications have a tendency to spread and
influence the production of other variations. The diversities thus
occasioned are more distinct than that mere individuality of style or
expression which may be likened to the differing chirography of men who
write, although such individual characteristics also constitute an
important element of confusion to the inexperienced observer. In
differing handwriting there is always an attempt or desire to represent
an alphabet which is essentially determinate, but no such fixedness or
limited condition of form restricts gesture speech.</p>

<p>Those variations and diversities of form and connected significance
specially calling for notice may be: 1st.&nbsp;In the nature of
synonyms. 2d.&nbsp;Substantially the same form with such different
signification as not to be synonymous. 3d.&nbsp;Difference in
significance produced by such slight variation in form as to be, to a
careless observer, <i>symmorphic</i>.</p>

<h5>SYNONYMS.</h5>

<p>In this division are placed signs of differing forms which are used
in senses so nearly the same as to have only a slight shade of
distinction, or sometimes to be practically interchangeable. The
comprehensive and metaphorical character of signs renders more of them
interchangeable than is the case with words; still, like words, some
signs with essential resemblance of meaning have partial and subordinate
differences made by etymology or usage. Doubtless signs are purposely
selected as delineating the most striking outlines of an object, or the
most characteristic features of an action; but different individuals,
and
<span class = "pagenum">342</span>
<a name = "page342" id = "page342"> </a>
likewise different bodies of people, would not always agree in the
selection of those outlines and features. Taking the illustration of the
attempt to invent a sign for <i>bird</i>, before used, any one of a
dozen signs might have been agreed upon with equal appropriateness, and,
in fact, a&nbsp;number have been so selected by several individuals and
tribes, each one, therefore, being a synonym of the other. Another
example of this is in the signs for <i>deer</i>, designated by various
modes of expressing fleetness, by his gait when not in rapid motion, by
the shape of his horns, by the color of his tail, and sometimes by
combinations of several of those characteristics. Each of these signs
may be indefinitely abbreviated, and therefore create indefinite
diversity. Another illustration, in which an association of ideas is
apparent, is in the upward raising of the index in front of and above
the head, which means <i>above</i> (sometimes containing the religious
conception of <i>heaven, great spirit</i>, &amp;c.), and also <i>now,
to-day</i>. Not unfrequently these several signs to express the same
ideas are used interchangeably by the same people, and some one of the
duplicates or triplicates may have been noticed by separate observers to
the exclusion of the others. On the other hand, they might all have been
noticed, but each one among different bodies. Thus confusing reports
would be received, which might either be erroneous in deducing the
prevalence of particular signs or the opposite. Sometimes the synonym
may be recognized as an imported sign, used with another tribe known to
affect it. Sometimes the diverse signs to express the same thing are
only different trials at reaching the intelligence of the person
addressed. An account is given by Lieut. Heber M. Creel, Seventh
Cavalry, U.S.A., of an old Cheyenne squaw, who made about twenty
successive and original signs to a recruit of the Fourth Cavalry to let
him know that she wanted to obtain out of a wagon a piece of cloth
belonging to her, to wipe out an oven preparatory to baking bread. Thus
by tradition, importation, recent invention, or from all these causes
together, several signs entirely distinct are produced for the same
object or action.</p>

<h5>THE SAME SIGN WITH DIVERSE MEANINGS.</h5>

<p>This class is not intended to embrace the cases common both to sign
and oral language where the same sign has several meanings, according to
the expression, whether facial or vocal, and the general manner
accompanying its delivery. The sign given, for “stop talking” on page
339 may be used in simple acquiescence, “very well,” “all right!” or for
comprehension, “I&nbsp;understand;” or in impatience, “you have talked
enough!” which may be carried further to express actual anger in the
violent “shut up!” But all these grades of thought accompany the idea of
a cessation of talk. In like manner an acquaintance of the writer asking
the same favor (a&nbsp;permission to go through their camp) of two
chiefs, was answered by both with the sign generally used for repletion
after eating, viz., the index and thumb turned toward the body, passed
up from the abdomen to the throat; but in the one case, being made with
a gentle motion and
<span class = "pagenum">343</span>
<a name = "page343" id = "page343"> </a>
pleasant look, it meant, “I&nbsp;am satisfied,” and granted the request;
in the other, made violently, with the accompaniment of a truculent
frown, it read, “I&nbsp;have had enough of that!” But these two meanings
might also have been expressed by different intonations of the English
word “enough.” The class of signs now in view is better exemplified by
the French word <i>souris</i>, which is spelled and pronounced precisely
the same with the two wholly distinct and independent significations of
<i>smile</i> and <i>mouse</i>. From many examples may be selected the
Omaha sign for <i>think, guess</i>, which is precisely the same as that
of the Absaroka, Shoshoni and Banak for <i>brave</i>, see page 414. The
context alone, both of the sign and the word, determines in what one of
its senses it is at the time used, but it is not discriminated merely by
a difference in expression.</p>

<p>It would have been very remarkable if precisely the same sign were
not used by different or even the same persons or bodies of people with
wholly distinct significations. The graphic forms for objects and ideas
are much more likely to be coincident than sound is for similar
expressions, yet in all oral languages the same precise sound is used
for utterly diverse meanings. The first conception of many different
objects must have been the same. It has been found, indeed, that the
homophony of words and the homomorphy of ideographic pictures is
noticeable in opposite significations, the conceptions arising from the
opposition itself. The differentiation in portraiture or accent is a
subsequent and remedial step not taken until after the confusion has
been observed and become inconvenient. Such confusion and contradiction
would only be eliminated if sign language were absolutely perfect as
well as absolutely universal.</p>

<h5>SYMMORPHS.</h5>

<p>In this class are included those signs conveying different ideas, and
really different in form of execution as well as in conception, yet in
which the difference in form is so slight as practically to require
attention and discrimination. An example from oral speech may be found
in the English word “desert,” which, as pronounced “des´-ert” or
“desert´,” and in a slightly changed form, “dessert,” has such widely
varying significations. These distinctions relating to signs require
graphic illustration.</p>

<p>The sign made by the Dakota, Hidatsa, and several other tribes, for
<i>tree</i> is made by holding the right hand before the body, back
forward, fingers and thumb separated, then pushing it slightly upward,
Fig. 112. That for <i>grass</i> is the same made near the ground; that
for <i>grow</i> is made like <i>grass</i>, though instead of holding the
back of the hand near the ground the hand is pushed upward in an
interrupted manner, Fig. 113. For <i>smoke</i>, the hand (with the back
down, fingers pointing upward as
<span class = "pagenum">344</span>
<a name = "page344" id = "page344"> </a>
in <i>grow</i>) is thrown upward several times from the same place
instead of continuing the whole motion upward. Frequently the fingers
are thrown forward from under the thumb with each successive upward
motion. For <i>fire</i>, the hand is employed as in the gesture for
<i>smoke</i>, but the motion is frequently more waving, and in other
cases made higher from the ground.</p>

<p>The sign for <i>rain</i>, made by the Shoshoni, Apache, and other
Indians, is by holding the hand (or&nbsp;hands) at the height of and
before the shoulder, fingers pendent, palm down, then pushing it
downward a short distance, Fig. 114. That for <i>heat</i> is the same,
with the difference that the hand is held above the head and thrust
downward toward the forehead; that for <i>to weep</i> is made by holding
the hand as in <i>rain</i>, and the gesture made from the eye downward
over the cheek, back of the fingers nearly touching the face.</p>

<p>The common sign for <i>sun</i> is made by bringing the tips of the
thumb and index together so as to form a circle; remaining fingers
closed. The hand is then held toward the sky, Fig. 115. The motion with
the same circular position of index and thumb is for <i>want</i>, by
bringing the hand backward toward the mouth, in a curve forming a short
arch between the origin and termination of the gesture.</p>

<p>For <i>drink</i> the gesture by several tribes is the same as for
<i>want</i>, with the slight difference in the position of the last
three fingers, which are not so tightly clinched, forming somewhat the
shape of a cup; and that for <i>money</i> is made by holding out the
hand with the same arrangement of fingers in front of the hips, at a
distance of about twelve or fifteen inches.</p>

<p>Another sign for <i>sun</i>, made by the Cheyennes, is by placing the
tips of the partly separated thumb and index of one hand against those
of the other, approximating a circle, and holding them toward the sky,
Fig. 116, and that for <i>various things</i>, observed among the Brulé
Sioux with the same position of the hands, is made by placing the circle
horizontal, and moving it interruptedly toward the right side, each
movement forming a short arch. Compare also the sign for <i>village</i>,
described on page 386.</p>

<p>The Arikara sign for <i>soldier</i> <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged: ‘is made by’?">is by</ins> placing the clinched hands
together before the breast, thumbs touching, then drawing them
horizontally outward toward their respective sides, Fig. 117. That for
<i>done</i>, made by
<span class = "pagenum">345</span>
<a name = "page345" id = "page345"> </a>
the Hidatsa, is shown below in this paper, see <a href = "#fig334">Fig.
334</a>, page 528. That for <i>much</i> (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;I,
<i>Comanche</i> III), see <a href = "#fig274">Fig. 274</a>, page 447, is
to be correlated with the above.</p>

<p class = "caption smallcaps">
Fig. 117.</p>

<p>The sign for <i>to be told</i> or <i>talked to</i>, and for the
reception of speech, by the tribes generally, is made by placing the
flat right hand, palm upward, about fifteen inches in front of the right
side of the face or breast, fingers pointing to the left, then drawing
the hand toward the bottom of the chin, and is illustrated in <a href =
"#fig71">Fig. 71</a>, page 291. The Comanche sign for <i>give</i> or
<i>asking</i> is shown in <a href = "#fig301">Fig. 301</a>, page 480
(<i>Comanche</i> III), and is made by bringing the hand toward the body
but a short distance, and the motion repeated, the tips of the fingers
indicating the outline of a circle.</p>

<p>The tribal sign for <i>Kaiowa</i>, illustrated in its place among the
<span class = "smallcaps">Tribal Signs</span>, is made by holding the
hand with extended and separated fingers and thumb near the side of the
head, back outward, and giving it a rotary motion. This gesture is made
in front of the face by many tribes. The generic sign for <i>deer</i>,
made by the Dakota and some others, is by holding the hand motionless at
the side of the head, with extended and separated thumb and fingers,
representing the branched antlers. That for <i>fool</i>, reported from
the same Indians, is the same as above described for <i>Kaiowa</i>,
which it also signifies, though frequently only one or two fingers are
used.</p>

<p>The tribal sign both for the <i>Sahaptin</i> or <i>Nez Percés</i> and
for <i>Caddo</i> (see <span class = "smallcaps">Tribal Signs</span>) is
made by passing the extended index, pointing under the nose from right
to left. When the second finger is not tightly closed it strongly
resembles the sign often made for <i>lie, falsehood</i>, by passing the
extended index and second fingers separated toward the left, over the
mouth.</p>

<p>The tribal sign for Cheyenne (see <span class = "smallcaps">Tribal
Signs</span>) differs from the sign for <i>spotted</i> only in the
finger (or&nbsp;hand) in the latter being alternately passed across the
upper and lower sides of the left forearm.</p>

<p>The sign for <i>steal, theft</i>, see <a href = "#fig75">Fig. 75</a>,
page 293, is but slightly different from that for <i>bear</i>, see <a
href = "#fig239">Fig. 239</a>, page 413, especially when the latter is
made with one hand only. The distinction, however, is that the grasping
in the latter sign is not followed by the idea of concealment in the
former, which is executed by the right hand, after the motion of
grasping, being brought toward and sometimes under the left armpit.</p>

<p><i>Cold</i> and <i>winter</i>, see Tendoy-Huerito Dialogue, page 486,
may be compared with <i>love</i>, see Kin Chē-ĕss’ speech, page 521, and
with <i>prisoner</i>. In these the difference consists in that
<i>cold</i> and <i>winter</i> are represented by crossing the arms with
clinched hands before the breast; <i>love</i> by crossing the arms so as
to bring the fists more under the chin, and <i>prisoner</i> by holding
the crossed wrists a foot in front of the breast.</p>

<p><i>Melon, squash, muskmelon</i>, used by the Utes and Apaches, is
made by
<span class = "pagenum">346</span>
<a name = "page346" id = "page346"> </a>
holding the hand arched, fingers separated and pointing forward, and
pushing the hand forward over a slight curve near the ground, and the
generic sign for <i>animals</i> by the Apaches is made in the same
manner at the height intended to represent the object.</p>

<p>The sign for <i>where?</i>, and <i>to search, to seek for</i>, made
by the Dakota (IV), is by holding the back of the hand upward, index
pointing forward, and carrying it from left to right about eight inches,
raising and lowering it several times while so doing, as if quickly
pointing at different objects. That for <i>some of them</i>, a part of a
number of things or persons, made by the Kaiowa, Comanche, Wichita, and
Apache Indians is nearly identical, the gesture being made less
rapidly.</p>

RESULTS SOUGHT IN THE STUDY OF SIGN LANGUAGE.</a></h3>

<p>These may be divided into (1) its practical application, (2) its aid
to philologic researches in general with (3)&nbsp;particular reference
to the grammatic machinery of language, and (4)&nbsp;its archæologic
relations.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_results_practical" id = "sign_results_practical">
PRACTICAL APPLICATION.</a></h4>

<p>The most obvious application of Indian sign language will for its
practical utility depend, to a large extent, upon the correctness of the
view submitted by the present writer that it is not a mere semaphoric
repetition of motions to be memorized from a limited traditional list,
but is a cultivated art, founded upon principles which can be readily
applied by travelers and officials, so as to give them much independence
of professional interpreters&mdash;as a class dangerously deceitful and
tricky. This advantage is not merely theoretical, but has been
demonstrated to be practical by a professor in a deaf-mute college who,
lately visiting several of the wild tribes of the plains, made himself
understood among all of them without knowing a word of any of their
languages; nor would it only be experienced in connection with American
tribes, being applicable to intercourse with savages in Africa and Asia,
though it is not pretended to fulfill by this agency the schoolmen’s
dream of an ecumenical mode of communication between all peoples in
spite of their dialectic divisions.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the practical value of signs for intercourse
with the American Indians will not long continue, their general progress
in the acquisition of English or of Spanish being so rapid that those
languages are becoming, to a surprising extent, the common medium, and
signs are proportionally disused. Nor is a systematic use of signs of so
great assistance in communicating with foreigners, whose speech is not
understood, as might at first be supposed, unless indeed both parties
agree to cease all attempt at oral language, relying wholly upon
gestures. So long as words are used at all, signs will be made only as
their accompaniment, and they will not always be ideographic.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">347</span>
<a name = "page347" id = "page347"> </a>
<p>An amusing instance in which savages showed their preference to signs
instead of even an onomatope may be quoted from Wilfred Powell’s
<i>Observations on New Britain and neighboring Islands during Six Years’
Exploration</i>, in <i>Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc.</i>, vol. iii, No.&nbsp;2
(new monthly series), February, 1881, p.&nbsp;89, 90: “On one occasion,
wishing to purchase a pig, and not knowing very well how to set about
it, being ignorant of the dialect, which is totally different from that
of the natives in the north, I&nbsp;asked Mr. Brown how I should manage,
or what he thought would be the best way of making them understand. He
said, ‘Why don’t you try grunting?’ whereupon I began to grunt most
vociferously. The effect was magical. Some of them jumped back, holding
their spears in readiness to throw; others ran away, covering their eyes
with their hands, and all exhibited the utmost astonishment and alarm.
In fact, it was so evident that they expected me to turn into a pig, and
their alarm was so irresistibly comic, that Mr. Brown and I both burst
out laughing, on which they gradually became more reassured, and those
that had run away came back, and seeing us so heartily amused, and that
I had not undergone any metamorphosis, began to laugh too; but when I
drew a pig on the sand with a piece of stick, and made motions of
eating, it suddenly seemed to strike them what was the matter, for they
all burst out laughing, nodding their heads, and several of them ran
off, evidently in quest of the pig that was required.”</p>

<h5>POWERS OF SIGNS COMPARED WITH SPEECH.</h5>

<p>Sign language, being the mother utterance of nature, poetically
styled by Lamartine the visible attitudes of the soul, is superior to
all others in that it permits every one to find in nature an image to
express his thoughts on the most needful matters intelligently to any
other person. The direct or substantial natural analogy peculiar to it
prevents a confusion of ideas. It is to some extent possible to use
words without understanding them which yet may be understood by those
addressed, but it is hardly possible to use signs without full
comprehension of them. Separate words may also be comprehended by
persons hearing them without the whole connected sense of the words
taken together being caught, but signs are more intimately connected.
Even those most appropriate will not be understood if the subject is
beyond the comprehension of their beholders. They would be as
unintelligible as the wild clicks of his instrument, in an electric
storm, would be to the telegrapher, or as the semaphore, driven by wind,
to the signalist. In oral speech even onomatopes are arbitrary, the most
strictly natural sounds striking the ear of different individuals and
nations in a manner wholly diverse. The instances given by <span class =
"smallcaps">Sayce</span> are in point. Exactly the same sound was
intended to be reproduced in the “<i>bilbit</i> amphora” of Nævius, the
“<i>glut glut</i> murmurat unda sonans” of the Latin Anthology, and the
“<i>puls</i>” of Varro. The Persian “<i>bulbul</i>,” the “<i>jugjug</i>”
of Gascoigne, and the “<i>whitwhit</i>” of others are all attempts at
imitating the note of the nightingale.
<span class = "pagenum">348</span>
<a name = "page348" id = "page348"> </a>
Successful signs must have a much closer analogy and establish a
<i>consensus</i> between the talkers far beyond that produced by the
mere sound of words.</p>

<p>Gestures, in the degree of their pantomimic character, excel in
graphic and dramatic effect applied to narrative and to rhetorical
exhibition, and beyond any other mode of description give the force of
reality. Speech, when highly cultivated, is better adapted to
generalization and abstraction; therefore to logic and metaphysics. The
latter must ever henceforth be the superior in formulating thoughts.
Some of the enthusiasts in signs have contended that this unfavorable
distinction is not from any inherent incapability, but because their
employment has not been continued unto perfection, and that if they had
been elaborated by the secular labor devoted to spoken language they
might in resources and distinctiveness have exceeded many forms of the
latter. Gallaudet, Peet, and others maybe right in asserting that man
could by his arms, hands, and fingers, with facial and bodily
accentuation, express any idea that could be conveyed by words.</p>

<p>The combinations which can be made with corporeal signs are infinite.
It has been before argued that a high degree of culture might have been
attained by man without articulate speech and it is but a further step
in the reasoning to conclude that if articulate speech had not been
possessed or acquired, necessity would have developed gesture language
to a degree far beyond any known exhibition of it. The continually
advancing civilization and continually increasing intercourse of
countless ages has perfected oral speech, and as both civilization and
intercourse were possible with signs alone it is to be supposed that
they would have advanced in some corresponding manner. But as sign
language has been chiefly used during historic time either as a
scaffolding around a more valuable structure to be thrown aside when the
latter was completed, or as an occasional substitute, such development
was not to be expected.</p>

<p>The process of forming signs to express abstract ideas is only a
variant from that of oral speech, in which the words for the most
abstract ideas, such as law, virtue, infinitude, and immortality, are
shown by Max Müller to have been derived and deduced, that is,
abstracted, from sensuous impressions. In the use of signs the
countenance and manner as well as the tenor decide whether objects
themselves are intended, or the forms, positions, qualities, and motions
of other objects which are suggested, and signs for moral and
intellectual ideas, founded on analogies, are common all over the world
as well as among deaf-mutes. Concepts of the intangible and invisible
are only learned through percepts of tangible and visible objects,
whether finally expressed to the eye or to the ear, in terms of sight or
of sound.</p>

<p>Sign language is so faithful to nature, and so essentially living in
its expression, that it is not probable that it will ever die. It may
become disused, but will revert. Its elements are ever natural and
universal, by recurring to which the less natural signs adopted
dialectically or for
<span class = "pagenum">349</span>
<a name = "page349" id = "page349"> </a>
expedition can always, with some circumlocution, be explained. This
power of interpreting itself is a peculiar advantage, for spoken
languages, unless explained by gestures or indications, can only be
interpreted by means of some other spoken language. When highly
cultivated, its rapidity on familiar subjects exceeds that of speech and
approaches to that of thought itself. This statement may be startling to
those who only notice that a selected spoken word may convey in an
instant a meaning for which the motions of even an expert in signs may
require a much longer time, but it must be considered that oral speech
is now wholly conventional, and that with the similar development of
sign language conventional expressions with hands and body could be made
more quickly than with the vocal organs, because more organs could be
worked at once. Without such supposed development the habitual
communication between deaf-mutes and among Indians using signs is
perhaps as rapid as between the ignorant class of speakers upon the same
subjects, and in many instances the signs would win at a trial of speed.
At the same time it must be admitted that great increase in rapidity is
chiefly obtained by the system of preconcerted abbreviations, before
explained, and by the adoption of arbitrary forms, in which naturalness
is sacrificed and conventionality established, as has been the case with
all spoken languages in the degree in which they have become copious and
convenient.</p>

<p>There is another characteristic of the gesture speech that, though it
cannot be resorted to in the dark, nor where the attention of the person
addressed has not been otherwise attracted, it has the countervailing
benefit of use when the voice could not be employed. This may be an
advantage at a distance which the eye can reach, but not the ear, and
still more frequently when silence or secrecy is desired. Dalgarno
recommends it for use in the presence of great people, who ought not to
be disturbed, and curiously enough “Disappearing Mist,” the Iroquois
chief, speaks of the former extensive use of signs in his tribe by women
and boys as a mark of respect to warriors and elders, their voices, in
the good old days, not being uplifted in the presence of the latter. The
decay of that wholesome state of discipline, he thinks, accounts partly
for the disappearance of the use of signs among the modern impudent
youth and the dusky claimants of woman’s rights.</p>

<p>An instance of the additional power gained to a speaker of ordinary
language by the use of signs, impressed the writer while dictating to
two amanuenses at the same moment, to the one by signs and the other by
words, on different subjects, a&nbsp;practice which would have enabled
Cæsar to surpass his celebrated feat. It would also be easy to talk to a
deaf and blind man at once, the latter being addressed by the voice and
the former in signs.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">350</span>
<a name = "page350" id = "page350"> </a>
his <i>Collectanea Etymologica</i>, without hitherto exciting any
thorough or scientific work in that direction, the obstacle to it
probably being that scholars competent in other respects had no adequate
data of the gesture speech of man to be used in comparison. The latter
will, it is hoped, be supplied by the work now undertaken.</p>

<p>In the first part of this paper it was suggested that signs played an
important part in giving meaning to spoken words. Philology, comparing
the languages of earth in their radicals, must therefore include the
graphic or manual presentation of thought, and compare the elements of
ideography with those of phonics. Etymology now examines the ultimate
roots, not the fanciful resemblances between oral forms, in the
different tongues; the internal, not the mere external parts of
language. A&nbsp;marked peculiarity of sign language consists in its
limited number of radicals and the infinite combinations into which
those radicals enter while still remaining distinctive. It is therefore
a proper field for etymologic study.</p>

<p>From these and other considerations it is supposed that an analysis
of the original conceptions of gestures, studied together with the
holophrastic roots in the speech of the gesturers, may aid in the
ascertainment of some relation between concrete ideas and words. Meaning
does not adhere to the phonic presentation of thought, while it does to
signs. The latter are doubtless more flexible and in that sense more
mutable than words, but the ideas attached to them are persistent, and
therefore there is not much greater metamorphosis in the signs than in
the cognitions. The further a language has been developed from its
primordial roots, which have been twisted into forms no longer
suggesting any reason for their original selection, and the more the
primitive significance of its words has disappeared, the fewer points of
contact can it retain with signs. The higher languages are more precise
because the consciousness of the derivation of most of their words is
lost, so that they have become counters, good for any sense agreed upon
and for no other.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible to ascertain the included gesture even in
many English words. The class represented by the word
<i>supercilious</i> will occur to all readers, but one or two examples
may be given not so obvious and more immediately connected with the
gestures of our Indians. <i>Imbecile</i>, generally applied to the
weakness of old age, is derived from the Latin <i>in</i>, in the sense
of on, and <i>bacillum</i>, a staff, which at once recalls the Cheyenne
sign for <i>old man</i>, mentioned above, page 339. So <i>time</i>
appears more nearly connected with <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "teinô">τείνω</span> to stretch, when information is given of
the sign for <i>long time</i>, in the Speech of Kin Chē-ĕss, in this
paper, viz., placing the thumbs and forefingers in such a position as if
a small thread was held between the thumb and forefinger of each hand,
the hands first touching each other, and then moving slowly from each
other, as if <i>stretching</i> a piece of gum-elastic.</p>

<p>In the languages of North America, which have not become arbitrary to
the degree exhibited by those of civilized man, the connection between
<span class = "pagenum">351</span>
<a name = "page351" id = "page351"> </a>
the idea and the word is only less obvious than that still unbroken
between the idea and the sign, and they remain strongly affected by the
concepts of outline, form, place, position, and feature on which gesture
is founded, while they are similar in their fertile combination of
radicals.</p>

<p>Indian language consists of a series of words that are but slightly
differentiated parts of speech following each other in the order
suggested in the mind of the speaker without absolute laws of
arrangement, as its sentences are not completely integrated. The
sentence necessitates parts of speech, and parts of speech are possible
only when a language has reached that stage where sentences are
logically constructed. The words of an Indian tongue, being synthetic or
undifferentiated parts of speech, are in this respect strictly analogous
to the gesture elements which enter into a sign language. The study of
the latter is therefore valuable for comparison with the words of the
former. The one language throws much light upon the other, and neither
can be studied to the best advantage without a knowledge of the
other.</p>

<p>Some special resemblances between the language of signs and the
character of the oral languages found on this continent may be
mentioned. Dr. <span class = "smallcaps">J.&nbsp;Hammond Trumbull</span>
remarks of the composition of their words that they were “so constructed
as to be thoroughly self-defining and immediately intelligible to the
hearer.” In another connection the remark is further enforced: “Indeed,
it is a requirement of the Indian languages that every word shall be so
framed as to admit of immediate resolution to its significant elements
by the hearer. It must be thoroughly <i>self-defining</i>, for
(as&nbsp;Max Müller has expressed&nbsp;it) ‘it requires tradition,
society, and literature to maintain words which can no longer be
analyzed at once.’ <span class = "ellipsis">***</span> In the
ever-shifting state of a nomadic society no debased coin can be
tolerated in language, no obscure legend accepted on trust. The metal
must be pure and the legend distinct.”</p>

<p>Indian languages, like those of higher development, sometimes exhibit
changes of form by the permutation of vowels, but often an incorporated
particle, whether suffix, affix, or infix, shows the etymology which
often, also, exhibits the same objective conception that would be
executed in gesture. There are, for instance, different forms for
standing, sitting, lying, falling, &amp;c., and for standing, sitting,
lying on or falling from the same level or a higher or lower level. This
resembles the pictorial conception and execution of signs.</p>

<p>Major <span class = "smallcaps">J. W. Powell</span>, with particular
reference to the disadvantages of the multiplied inflections in Indian
languages, alike with the Greek and Latin, when the speaker is
compelled, in the choice of a word to express his idea, to think of a
great multiplicity of things, gives the following instance:</p>

<p>“A Ponca Indian in saying that a man killed a rabbit, would have to
say: the man, he, one, animate, standing, in the nominative case,
purposely killed, by shooting an arrow, the rabbit, he, the one,
animate, sitting, in the objective case; for the form of a verb to kill
would have
<span class = "pagenum">352</span>
<a name = "page352" id = "page352"> </a>
to be selected, and the verb changes its form by inflection and
incorporated particles to denote person, number, and gender as animate
or inanimate, and gender as standing, sitting, or lying, and case; and
the form of the verb would also express whether the killing was done
accidentally or purposely, and whether it was by shooting or by some
other process, and, if by shooting, whether by bow and arrow, or with a
gun; and the form of the verb would in like manner have to express all
of these things relating to the object; that is, the person, number,
gender, and case of the object; and from the multiplicity of
paradigmatic forms of the verb to kill, this particular one would have
to be selected.” This is substantially the mode in which an Indian sign
talker would find it necessary to tell the story, as is shown by several
examples given below in narratives, speeches, and dialogues.</p>

<p>Indian languages exhibit the same fondness for demonstration which is
necessary in sign language. The two forms of utterance are alike in
their want of power to express certain words, such as the verb “to be,”
and in the criterion of organization, so far as concerns a high degree
of synthesis and imperfect differentiation, they bear substantially the
same relation to the English language.</p>

<p>It may finally be added that as not only proper names but nouns,
generally in Indian languages are connotive, predicating some attribute
of the object, they can readily be expressed by gesture signs, and
therefore among them, if anywhere, it is to be expected that relations
may be established between the words and the signs.</p>

<h5>ETYMOLOGY OF WORDS FROM GESTURES.</h5>

<p>There can be no attempt in the present limits to trace the etymology
of any large number of words in the several Indian languages to a
gestural origin, nor, if the space allowed, would it be satisfactory.
The signs have scarcely yet been collected, verified, and collated in
sufficient numbers for such comparison, even with the few of the Indian
languages the radicals of which have been scientifically studied. The
signs will, in a future work, be frequently presented in connection with
the corresponding words of the gesturers, as is done now in a few
instances in another part of this paper. For the present the subject is
only indicated by the following examples, introduced to suggest the
character of the study in which the students of American linguistics are
urgently requested to assist:</p>

<p>The Dakota word <i>Shaⁿte-suta</i>&mdash;from <i>shaⁿte</i>, heart,
and <i>suta</i>, strong&mdash;<i>brave</i>, not cowardly, literally
strong-hearted, is made by several tribes of that stock, and
particularly by the Brulé Sioux, in gestures by collecting the tips of
the fingers and thumb of the right hand to a point, and then placing the
radial side of the hand over the heart, finger tips pointing
downward&mdash;<i>heart</i>; then place the left fist, palm inward,
horizontally before the lower portion of the breast, the right fist back
of the
<span class = "pagenum">353</span>
<a name = "page353" id = "page353"> </a>
left, then raise the right and throw it forcibly over and downward in
front of the left&mdash;<i>brave, strong</i>. See <a href =
"#fig242">Fig. 242</a>, page 415.</p>

<p>The Arikaras make the sign for <i>brave</i> by striking the clinched
fist forcibly toward the ground in front of and near the breast.</p>

<p>Brave, or “strong-hearted,” is made by the Absaroka, Shoshoni, and
Banak Indians by merely placing the clinched fist to the breast, the
latter having allusion to the heart, the clinching of the hand to
strength, vigor, or force.</p>

<p>An Ojibwa sign for <i>death, to die</i>, is as follows:</p>

<p>Place the palm of the hand at a short distance from the side of the
head, then withdraw it gently in an oblique downward direction,
inclining the head and upper part of the body in the same direction.</p>

<p>The same authority, The Very Rev. E. Jacker, who contributes it,
notes that there is an apparent connection between this conception and
execution and the etymology of the corresponding terms in Ojibwa. “He
dies,” is <i>nibo</i>; “he sleeps,” is <i>niba</i>. The common idea
expressed by the gesture is a sinking to rest. The original significance
of the root <i>nib</i> seems to be “leaning;” <i>anibeia</i>, “it is
leaning”; <i>anibekweni</i>, “he inclines the head sidewards.” The word
<i>niba</i> or <i>nibe</i> (only in compounds) conveys the idea of
“night,” perhaps as the falling over, the going to rest, or the death of
the day.</p>

<p><i>Ogima</i>, the Ojibwa term for <i>chief</i>, is derived from a
root which signifies “above” (<i>Ogidjaii</i>, upon; <i>ogidjina</i>,
above; <i>ogidaki</i>, on a hill or mountain, etc.). <i>Ogitchida</i>, a
brave, a&nbsp;hero (Otawa, <i>ogida</i>), is probably from the same
root.</p>

<p><i>Sagima</i>, the Ojibwa form of sachem, is from the root
<i>sag</i>, which implies a coming forth, or stretching out. These roots
are to be considered in connection with several gestures described under
the head of <i>Chief</i>, in <span class = "smallcaps">Extracts from
Dictionary</span>, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p><i>Onijishin</i>, it is <i>good</i> (<i>Ojibwa</i>), originally
signifies “it lies level.” This may be compared with the sign for
<i>good</i>, in the Tendoy-Huerito Dialogue, <a href = "#fig309">Fig.
309</a>, page 487, and also that for <i>happy, contentment</i>, in the
Speech of Kin Chē-ĕss, page 523.</p>

<p>In Klamath the radix <i>lam</i> designates a whirling motion, and
appears in the word <i>láma</i>, “to be crazy, mad,” readily correlated
with the common gesture for <i>madman</i> and <i>fool</i>, in which the
hand is rotated above and near the head.</p>

<p><i>Evening</i>, in Klamath, is <i>litkhí</i>, from <i>luta</i>, to
hang down, meaning the time when the sun hangs down, the gesture for
which, described elsewhere in this paper (see Nátci’s Narrative, page
503), is executive of the same conception, which is allied to the
etymology usually given for <i>eve, even</i>, “the decline of the day.”
These Klamath etymologies have been kindly contributed by Mr. A.&nbsp;S.
Gatschet.</p>

<p>The Very Rev. E. Jacker also communicates a suggestive <i>excursus
exegeticus</i> upon the probable gestural origin of the Ojibwa word
<i>tibishko</i>, “opposite in space; just so; likewise:”</p>

<p>“The adverb <i>tibishko</i> (or <i>dibishko</i>) is an offshoot of
the root <i>tib</i> (or&nbsp;<i>dib</i>),
<span class = "pagenum">354</span>
<a name = "page354" id = "page354"> </a>
which in most cases conveys the idea of measuring or weighing, as
appears from the following samples: <i>dibaige</i>, he measures;
<i>dibowe</i>, he settles matters by his speech or word, <i>e.g.</i>, as
a juryman; <i>dibaamage</i>, he pays out; <i>dibakonige</i>, he judges;
<i>dibabishkodjige</i>, he weighs; <i>dibamenimo</i>, he restricts
himself, <i>e.g.</i>, to a certain quantity of food;
<i>dibissitchige</i>, he fulfills a promise; <i>dibijigan</i>, a pattern
for cutting clothes.</p>

<p>“The original meaning of <i>tib</i>, however, must be supposed to
have been more comprehensive, if we would explain other (apparent)
derivatives, such as: <i>tibi</i>, ‘I don’t know where, where to, where
from,’ &amp;c.; <i>tibik</i>, night; <i>dibendjige</i>, he is master or
owner; <i>titibisse</i>, it rolls (as&nbsp;a ball), it turns (as&nbsp;a
wheel); <i>dibaboweigan</i>, the cover of a kettle. The notion of
measuring does not very naturally enter into the ideas expressed by
these terms.</p>

<p>“The difficulty disappears if we assume the root <i>tib</i> or
<i>dib</i> to have been originally the phonetic equivalent of a
<i>gesture</i> expressive of the notion of covering as well as of that
of measuring. This gesture would seem to be the holding of one hand
above the other, horizontally, at some distance, palms opposite or both
downwards. This, or some similar gesture would most naturally accompany
the above terms. As for <i>tibik</i>, night, compare (<i>Dunbar</i>):
‘The two hands open and extended, crossing one another horizontally.’
The idea of covering evidently enters into this conception. The strange
adverb <i>tibi</i> (‘I don’t know where,’ &amp;c., or ‘in a place
unknown to&nbsp;me’), if derived from the same root, would originally
signify ‘covered.’ In <i>titibisse</i>, or <i>didibisse</i>
(it&nbsp;rolls, it turns), the reduplication of the radical syllable
indicates the repetition of the gesture, by holding the hands
alternately above one another, palms downwards, and thus producing a
rotary motion.</p>

<p>“In German, the clasping of the hands in a horizontal position,
expressive of a promise or the conclusion of a bargain, is frequently
accompanied by the interjection <i>top!</i> the same radical consonants
as in <i>tib</i>. Compare also the English <i>tap</i>, the French
<i>tape</i>, the Greek <span class = "greek" lang = "el" title =
"tuptô [with comma misplaced after preceding word]">τύπτω</span>, the
Sanscrit <i>tup</i> and <i>tub</i>, &amp;c.”</p>

<h5>GESTURES CONNECTED WITH THE ORIGIN OF WRITING.</h5>

<p>Though written characters are generally associated with speech, they
are shown, by successful employment in hieroglyphs and by educated
deaf-mutes to be representative of ideas without the intervention of
sounds, and so also are the outlines of signs. This will be more
apparent if the motions expressing the most prominent feature,
attribute, or function of an object are made, or supposed to be made, so
as to leave a luminous track impressible upon the eye separate from the
members producing it. The actual result is an immateriate graphic
representation of visible objects and qualities which, invested with
substance, has become familiar to us as the <i>rebus</i>, and also
appears in the form of heraldic blazonry styled punning or
“canting.”</p>

<p>Gesture language is, in fact, not only a picture language, but is
actual writing, though dissolving and sympathetic, and neither
alphabetic nor phonetic.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">355</span>
<a name = "page355" id = "page355"> </a>
<p>Dalgarno aptly says: “<i>Qui enim caput nutat, oculo connivet,
digitum movet in aëre, &amp;c., (ad&nbsp;mentis cogitata exprimendum);
is non minus vere scribit, quam qui Literas pingit in Charta, Marmore,
vel ære.</i>”</p>

<p>It is neither necessary nor proper to enter now upon any prolonged
account of the origin of alphabetic writing. There is, however,
propriety, if not necessity, for the present writer, when making any
remarks under this heading and under some others in this paper
indicating special lines of research, to disclaim all pretension to
being a Sinologue or Egyptologist, or even profoundly versed in Mexican
antiquities. His partial and recently commenced studies only enable him
to present suggestions for the examination of scholars. These
suggestions may safely be introduced by the statement that the common
modern alphabetic characters, coming directly from the Romans, were
obtained by them from the Greeks, and by the latter from the Phœnicians,
whose alphabet was connected with that of the old Hebrew. It has also
been of late the general opinion that the whole family of alphabets to
which the Greek, Latin, Gothic, Runic, and others belong, appearing
earlier in the Phœnician, Moabite, and Hebrew, had its beginning in the
ideographic pictures of the Egyptians, afterwards used by them to
express sounds. That the Chinese, though in a different manner from the
Egyptians, passed from picture writing to phonetic writing, is
established by delineations still extant among them, called
<i>ku-wăn</i>, or “ancient pictures,” with which some of the modern
written characters can be identified. The ancient Mexicans also, to some
extent, developed phonetic expressions out of a very elaborate system of
ideographic picture writing. Assuming that ideographic pictures made by
ancient peoples would be likely to contain representations of gesture
signs, which subject is treated of below, it is proper to examine if
traces of such gesture signs may not be found in the Egyptian, Chinese,
and Aztec characters. Only a few presumptive examples, selected from a
considerable number, are now presented in which the signs of the North
American Indians appear to be included, with the hope that further
investigation by collaborators will establish many more instances not
confined to Indian signs.</p>

<p>A typical sign made by the Indians for <i>no, negation</i>, is as
follows: The hand extended or slightly curved is held in front of the
body, a&nbsp;little to the right of the median line; it is then carried
with a rapid sweep a foot or more farther to the right. (<i>Mandan and
Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>One for <i>none, nothing</i>, sometimes used for simple negation, is
also given: Throw both hands outward toward their respective sides from
the breast. (<i>Wyandot</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>With these compare the two forms of the Egyptian character for <i>no,
negation</i>, Fig. 118, taken from Champollion, <i>Grammaire
Égyptienne</i>, <i>Paris</i>, 1836, p.&nbsp;519.</p>

<p>No vivid fancy is needed to see the hands indicated at the
extremities of arms extended symmetrically from the body on each
side.</p>

<p>Also compare the Maya character for the same idea of negation,

<a name = "page356" id = "page356"> </a>
Fig. 119, found in Landa, <i>Relation des Choses de Yucatan</i>,
<i>Paris</i>, 1864, 316. The Maya word for negation is “<i>ma</i>,” and
the word “<i>mak</i>,” a six-foot measuring rod, given by Brasseur de
Bourbourg in his dictionary, apparently having connection with this
character, would in use separate the hands as illustrated, giving the
same form as the gesture made without the rod.</p>

<p>Another sign for <i>nothing, none</i>, made by the Comanches, is:
Flat hand thrown forward, back to the ground, fingers pointing forward
and downward. Frequently the right hand is brushed over the left thus
thrown out.</p>

<p>Compare the Chinese character for the same meaning, Fig. 120. This

the fingers, pointing forward and downward.</p>

<p>The Arapaho sign for <i>child, baby</i>, is the forefinger in the
mouth, <i>i.e.</i>, a nursing child, and a natural sign of a deaf-mute
is the same. The Egyptian figurative character for the same is seen in
Fig. 121. Its linear form is Fig. 122, and its hieratic is Fig. 123
(Champollion, <i>Dictionnaire Égyptien</i>, <i>Paris</i>, 1841,

<p>These afford an interpretation to the ancient Chinese form for
<i>son</i>, Fig. 124, given in <i>Journ. Royal Asiatic Society</i>, I,
1834, p.&nbsp;219, as belonging to the Shang dynasty, 1756, 1112 B.C.,
and the modern Chinese form, Fig. 125, which, without the comparison,
would not be supposed to have any pictured reference to an infant with
hand or finger at or approaching the mouth, denoting the taking of
nourishment. Having now suggested this, the Chinese character for
<i>birth</i>, Fig. 126, is understood as the expression of a common
gesture among the Indians, particularly reported from the Dakota, for
<i>born, to be born</i>, viz: Place the left hand in front of the body,
a&nbsp;little to the right, the palm downward and slightly arched, then
pass the extended right hand downward, forward, and upward, forming a
short curve underneath the left, as in Fig. 127 (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;V).
This is based upon the curve followed by the head of the child during
birth, and is used generically. The same curve, when made with one hand,
appears in Fig. 128.</p>

water with the drops falling or about to fall, is shown in Fig. 137,
taken from the same author (p.&nbsp;349), being the same arrangement of
them as in the sign for <i>rain</i>, <a href = "#fig114">Fig. 114</a>,

(Sharpe, from a funereal stelē in the British Museum, in <i>Cooper’s

<p>The common Indian gesture for <i>river</i> or <i>stream, water</i>,

the left from the right side in a serpentine manner.</p>

<p>The Egyptian character for the same is Fig. 139 (Champollion,

movement of the water on the surface of the stream. When made with one
line less angular and more waving it means <i>water</i>. It is
interesting to compare with this the identical character in the
syllabary invented by a West African negro, Mormoru Doalu Bukere, for

<p>The Egyptian character for <i>weep</i>, Fig. 142, an eye, with tears
falling, is also found in the pictographs of the Ojibwa (Schoolcraft, I,
pl. 54, Fig.&nbsp;27), and is also made by the Indian gesture of drawing
lines by the index repeatedly downward from the eye, though perhaps more
frequently made by the full sign for <i>rain</i>, described on page 344,
made with the back of the hand downward from the eye&mdash;“eye
rain.”</p>

<p>The Egyptian character for <i>to be strong</i> is Fig. 143

<p>The Egyptian character, Fig. 148, which in its linear form is
represented in Fig. 149, and meaning to <i>go</i>, to <i>come,
locomotion</i>, is presented to show readers unfamiliar with
hieroglyphics how a corporeal action may be included in a linear
character without being obvious or at least certain, unless it should be
made clear by comparison with the full figurative form or by other
means. This linear form might be noticed many times without certainty or
perhaps suspicion that it represented the human legs and feet in the act
of walking. The same difficulty, of course, as also the same prospect of
success by careful research, attends the tracing of other corporeal
motions which more properly come under the head of gesture signs.</p>

SIGN LANGUAGE WITH REFERENCE TO GRAMMAR.</a></h4>

<p>Apart from the more material and substantive relations between signs
and language, it is to be expected that analogies can by proper research
be ascertained between their several developments in the manner of their
use, that is, in their grammatic mechanism, and in the genesis of the
sentence. The science of language, ever henceforward to be studied
historically, must take account of the similar early mental processes in
which the phrase or sentence originated, both in sign and oral
utterance. In this respect, as in many others, the North American
Indians may be considered to be living representatives of prehistoric
man.</p>

<h5>SYNTAX.</h5>

<p>The reader will understand without explanation that there is in the
gesture speech no organized sentence such as is integrated in the
languages of civilization, and that he must not look for articles or
particles or passive voice or case or grammatic gender, or even what
appears in those languages as a substantive or a verb, as a subject or a
predicate, or as qualifiers or inflexions. The sign radicals, without
being specifically any of our parts of speech, may be all of them in
turn. There is, however,
<span class = "pagenum">360</span>
<a name = "page360" id = "page360"> </a>
a grouping and sequence of the ideographic pictures, an arrangement of
signs in connected succession, which may be classed under the scholastic
head of syntax. This subject, with special reference to the order of
deaf-mute signs as compared with oral speech, has been the theme of much
discussion, some notes of which, condensed from the speculations of
M.&nbsp;Rémi Valade and others, follow in the next paragraph without
further comment than may invite attention to the profound remark of
<span class = "smallcaps">Leibnitz</span>.</p>

<p>In mimic construction there are to be considered both the order in
which the signs succeed one another and the relative positions in which
they are made, the latter remaining longer in the memory than the
former, and spoken language may sometimes in its early infancy have
reproduced the ideas of a sign picture without commencing from the same
point. So the order, as in Greek and Latin, is very variable. In nations
among whom the alphabet was introduced without the intermediary to any
impressive degree of picture-writing, the order being (1)&nbsp;language
of signs, almost superseded by (2)&nbsp;spoken language, and
(3)&nbsp;alphabetic writing, men would write in the order in which they
had been accustomed to speak. But if at a time when spoken language was
still rudimentary, intercourse being mainly carried on by signs,
figurative writing had been invented, the order of the figures would be
the order of the signs, and the same order would pass into the spoken
language. Hence <span class = "smallcaps">Leibnitz</span> says truly
that “the writing of the Chinese might seem to have been invented by a
deaf person.” The oral language has not known the phases which have
given to the Indo-European tongues their formation and grammatical
parts. In the latter, signs were conquered by speech, while in the
former, speech received the yoke.</p>

<p>Sign language cannot show by inflection the reciprocal dependence of
words and sentences. Degrees of motion corresponding with vocal
intonation are only used rhetorically or for degrees of comparison. The
relations of ideas and objects are therefore expressed by placement, and
their connection is established when necessary by the abstraction of
ideas. The sign talker is an artist, grouping persons and things so as
to show the relations between them, and the effect is that which is seen
in a picture. But though the artist has the advantage in presenting in a
permanent connected scene the result of several transient signs, he can
only present it as it appears at a single moment. The sign talker has
the succession of time at his disposal, and his scenes move and act, are
localized and animated, and their arrangement is therefore more varied
and significant.</p>

<p>It is not satisfactory to give the order of equivalent words as
representative of the order of signs, because the pictorial arrangement
is wholly lost; but adopting this expedient as a mere illustration of
the sequence in the presentation of signs by deaf-mutes, the following
is quoted from an essay by Rev. J.&nbsp;R. Keep, in <i>American Annals
of the
<span class = "pagenum">361</span>
<a name = "page361" id = "page361"> </a>
Deaf and Dumb</i>, vol. xvi, p.&nbsp;223, as the order in which the
parable of the Prodigal Son is translated into signs:</p>

<p>“Once, man one, sons two. Son younger say, Father property your
divide: part my, me give. Father so.&mdash;Son each, part his give. Days
few after, son younger money all take, country far go, money spend, wine
drink, food nice eat. Money by and by gone all. Country everywhere food
little: son hungry very. Go seek man any, me hire. Gentleman meet.
Gentleman son send field swine feed. Son swine husks eat, see&mdash;self
husks eat want&mdash;cannot&mdash;husks him give nobody. Son thinks,
say, father my, servants many, bread enough, part give away can&mdash;I
none&mdash;starve, die. I&nbsp;decide: Father I go to, say I bad, God
disobey, you disobey&mdash;name my hereafter <i>son</i>, no&mdash;I
unworthy. You me work give servant like. So son begin go. Father far
look: son see, pity, run, meet, embrace. Son father say, I&nbsp;bad, you
disobey, God disobey&mdash;name my hereafter <i>son</i>, no&mdash;I
unworthy. But father servants call, command robe best bring, son put on,
ring finger put on, shoes feet put on, calf fat bring, kill. We all eat,
merry. Why? Son this my formerly dead, now alive: formerly lost, now
found: rejoice.”</p>

<p>It may be remarked, not only from this example, but from general
study, that the verb “to be” as a copula or predicant does not have any
place in sign language. It is shown, however, among deaf-mutes as an
assertion of presence or existence by a sign of stretching the arms and
hands forward and then adding the sign of affirmation. <i>Time</i> as
referred to in the conjunctions <i>when</i> and <i>then</i> is not
gestured. Instead of the form, “When I have had a sleep I will go to the
river,” or “After sleeping I will go to the river,” both deaf-mutes and
Indians would express the intention by “Sleep done, I&nbsp;river go.”
Though time present, past, and future is readily expressed in signs (see
page 366), it is done once for all in the connection to which it
belongs, and once established is not repeated by any subsequent
intimation, as is commonly the case in oral speech. Inversion, by which
the object is placed before the action, is a striking feature of the
language of deaf-mutes, and it appears to follow the natural method by
which objects and actions enter into the mental conception. In striking
a rock the natural conception is not first of the abstract idea of
striking or of sending a stroke into vacancy, seeing nothing and having
no intention of striking anything in particular, when suddenly a rock
rises up to the mental vision and receives the blow; the order is that
the man sees the rock, has the intention to strike it, and does so;
therefore he gestures, “I&nbsp;rock strike.” For further illustration of
this subject, a&nbsp;deaf-mute boy, giving in signs the compound action
of a man shooting a bird from a tree, first represented the tree, then
the bird as alighting upon it, then a hunter coming toward and looking
at it, taking aim with a gun, then the report of the latter and the
falling and the dying gasps of the bird. These are undoubtedly the
successive steps that an artist would have taken in drawing the picture,
or rather successive pictures, to illustrate the story. It is, however,
<span class = "pagenum">362</span>
<a name = "page362" id = "page362"> </a>
urged that this pictorial order natural to deaf-mutes is not natural to
the congenitally blind who are not deaf-mute, among whom it is found to
be rhythmical. It is asserted that blind persons not carefully educated
usually converse in a metrical cadence, the action usually coming first
in the structure of the sentence. The deduction is that all the senses
when intact enter into the mode of intellectual conception in proportion
to their relative sensitiveness and intensity, and hence no one mode of
ideation can be insisted on as normal to the exclusion of others.</p>

<p>Whether or not the above statement concerning the blind is true, the
conceptions and presentations of deaf-mutes and of Indians using sign
language because they cannot communicate by speech, are confined to
optic and, therefore, to pictorial arrangement.</p>

<p>The abbé Sicard, dissatisfied with the want of tenses and
conjunctions, indeed of most of the modern parts of speech, in the
natural signs, and with their inverted order, attempted to construct a
new language of signs, in which the words should be given in the order
of the French or other spoken language adopted, which of course required
him to supply a sign for every word of spoken language. Signs, whatever
their character, could not become associated with words, or suggest
them, until words had been learned. The first step, therefore, was to
explain by means of natural signs, as distinct from the new signs styled
methodical, the meaning of a passage of verbal language. Then each word
was taken separately and a sign affixed to it, which was to be learned
by the pupil. If the word represented a physical object, the sign would
be the same as the natural sign, and would be already understood,
provided the object had been seen and was familiar; and in all cases the
endeavor was to have the sign convey as strong a suggestion of the
meaning of the word as was possible. The final step was to gesticulate
these signs, thus associated with words, in the exact order in which the
words were to stand in a sentence. Then the pupil would write the very
words desired in the exact order desired. If the previous explanation in
natural signs had not been sufficiently full and careful, he would not
understand the passage. The methodical signs did not profess to give him
the ideas, except in a very limited degree, but only to show him how to
express ideas according to the order and methods of spoken language. As
there were no repetitions of time in narratives in the sign language, it
became necessary to unite with the word-sign for verbs others, to
indicate the different tenses of the verbs, and so by degrees the
methodical signs not only were required to comprise signs for every
word, but also, with every such sign, a&nbsp;grammatical sign to
indicate what part of speech the word was, and, in the case of verbs,
still other signs to show their tenses and corresponding inflections. It
was, as Dr. Peet remarks, a&nbsp;cumbrous and unwieldly vehicle, ready
at every step to break down under the weight of its own machinery.
Nevertheless, it was industriously taught in all our schools from the
date of the founding
<span class = "pagenum">363</span>
<a name = "page363" id = "page363"> </a>
of the American Asylum in 1817 down to about the year 1835, when it was
abandoned.</p>

<p>The collection of narratives, speeches, and dialogues of our Indians
in sign language, first systematically commenced by the present writer,
several examples of which are in this paper, has not yet been
sufficiently complete and exact to establish conclusions on the subject
of the syntactic arrangement of their signs. So far as studied it seems
to be similar to that of deaf-mutes and to retain the characteristic of
pantomimes in figuring first the principal idea and adding the
accessories successively in the order of importance, the ideographic
expressions being in the ideologic order. If the examples given are not
enough to establish general rules of construction, they at least show
the natural order of ideas in the minds of the gesturers and the several
modes of inversion by which they pass from the known to the unknown,
beginning with the dominant idea or that supposed to be best known. Some
special instances of expedients other than strictly syntactic coming
under the machinery broadly designated as grammar may be mentioned.</p>

<h5>DEGREES OF COMPARISON.</h5>

<p>Degrees of comparison are frequently expressed, both by deaf-mutes
and by Indians, by adding to the generic or descriptive sign that for
“big” or “little.” <i>Damp</i> would be “wet&mdash;little”; <i>cool</i>,
“cold&mdash;little”; <i>hot</i>, “warm&mdash;much.” The amount or force
of motion also often indicates corresponding diminution or augmentation,
but sometimes expresses a different shade of meaning, as is reported by
Dr. Matthews with reference to the sign for <i>bad</i> and
<i>contempt</i>, see page 411. This change in degree of motion is,
however, often used for emphasis only, as is the raising of the voice in
speech or italicizing and capitalizing in print. The Prince of Wied
gives an instance of a comparison in his sign for <i>excessively
hard</i>, first giving that for <i>hard</i>, viz: Open the left hand,
and strike against it several times with the right (with the backs of
the fingers). Afterwards he gives <i>hard, excessively</i>, as follows:
Sign for <i>hard</i>, then place the left index-finger upon the right
shoulder, at the same time extend and raise the right arm high,
extending the index-finger upward, perpendicularly.</p>

<p>Rev. G. L. Deffenbaugh describes what may perhaps be regarded as an
intensive sign among the Sahaptins in connection with the sign for
<i>good</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, <i>very good</i>. “Place the left hand in
position in front of the body with all fingers closed except first,
thumb lying on second, then with forefinger of right hand extended in
same way point to end of forefinger of left hand, move it up the arm
till near the body and then to a point in front of breast to make the
sign <i>good</i>.” For the latter see <span class = "smallcaps">Extracts
from Dictionary</span> page 487, <i>infra</i>. The same special motion
is prefixed to the sign for <i>bad</i> as an intensive.</p>

<p>Another intensive is reported by Mr. Benjamin Clark, interpreter at
the Kaiowa, Comanche, and Wichita agency, Indian Territory, in which
after the sign for <i>bad</i> is made, that for <i>strong</i> is used by
the Comanches
<span class = "pagenum">364</span>
<a name = "page364" id = "page364"> </a>
as follows: Place the clinched left fist horizontally in front of the
breast, back forward, then pass the palmar side of the right fist
downward in front of the knuckles of the left.</p>

<p>Dr. W. H. Corbusier, assistant surgeon U.S.A., writes as follows in
response to a special inquiry on the subject: “By carrying the right
fist from behind forward over the left, instead of beginning the motion
six inches above it, the Arapaho sign for <i>strong</i> is made. For
<i>brave</i>, first strike the chest over the heart with the right fist
two or three times, and then make the sign for <i>strong</i>.</p>

<p>“The sign for <i>strong</i> expresses the superlative when used with
other signs; with coward it denotes a base coward; with hunger,
starvation; and with sorrow, bitter sorrow. I&nbsp;have not seen it used
with the sign for pleasure or that of <ins class = "correction" title =
"obvious error unchanged (see beginning of paragraph)">hunger</ins>, nor
can I learn that it is ever used with them.”</p>

<h5>OPPOSITION.</h5>

<p>The principle of opposition, as between the right and left hands, and
between the thumb and forefinger and the little finger, appears among
Indians in some expressions for “above,” “below,” “forward,” “back,” but
is not so common as among the methodical, distinguished from the
natural, signs of deaf-mutes. It is also connected with the attempt to
express degrees of comparison. <i>Above</i> is sometimes expressed by
holding the left hand horizontal, and in front of the body, fingers
open, but joined together, palm upward. The right hand is then placed
horizontal, fingers open but joined, palm downward, an inch or more
above the left, and raised and lowered a few inches several times, the
left hand being perfectly still. If the thing indicated as “above” is
only a <i>little</i> above, this concludes the sign, but if it be
<i>considerably</i> above, the right hand is raised higher and higher as
the height to be expressed is greater, until, if <i>enormously</i>
above, the Indian will raise his right hand as high as possible, and,
fixing his eyes on the zenith, emit a duplicate grunt, the more
prolonged as he desires to express the greater height. All this time the
left hand is held perfectly motionless. <i>Below</i> is gestured in a
corresponding manner, all movement being made by the left or lower hand,
the right being held motionless, palm downward, and the eyes looking
down.</p>

<p>The code of the Cistercian monks was based in large part on a system
of opposition which seems to have been wrought out by an elaborate
process of invention rather than by spontaneous figuration, and is more
of mnemonic than suggestive value. They made two fingers at the right
side of the nose stand for “friend,” and the same at the left side for
“enemy,” by some fanciful connection with right and wrong, and placed
the little finger on the tip of the nose for “fool” merely because it
had been decided to put the forefinger there for “wise man.”</p>

<h5>PROPER NAMES.</h5>

<p>It is well known that the names of Indians are almost always
connotive, and particularly that they generally refer to some animal,
predicating
<span class = "pagenum">365</span>
<a name = "page365" id = "page365"> </a>
often some attribute or position of that animal. Such names readily
admit of being expressed in sign language, but there may be sometimes a
confusion between the sign expressing the animal which is taken as a
name-totem, and the sign used, not to designate that animal, but as a
proper name. A&nbsp;curious device to differentiate proper names was
observed as resorted to by a Brulé Dakota. After making the sign of the
animal he passed his index forward from the mouth in a direct line, and
explained it orally as “that is his name,” <i>i.e.</i>, the name of the
person referred to. This approach to a grammatic division of
substantives maybe correlated with the mode in which many tribes,
especially the Dakotas, designate names in their pictographs,
<i>i.e.</i>, by a line from the mouth of the figure drawn representing a
man to the animal, also drawn with proper color or position. Fig. 150
thus shows the name of Shuⁿ-ka Luta, Red Dog, an Ogallalla chief, drawn
by himself. The shading of the dog by vertical lines is designed to
represent red, or <i>gules</i>, according to the heraldic scheme of
colors, which is used in other parts of this paper where it seemed
useful to designate particular colors. The writer possesses in painted
robes many examples in which lines are drawn from the mouth to a
name-totem.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be interesting to dwell more than is now allowed upon the
peculiar objectiveness of Indian proper names with the result, if not
the intention, that they can all be signified in gesture, whereas the
best sign-talker among deaf-mutes is unable to translate the proper
names occurring in his speech or narrative and, necessarily ceasing
signs, resorts to the dactylic alphabet. Indians are generally named at
first according to a clan or totemic system, but later in life often
acquire a new name or perhaps several names in succession from some
exploit or adventure. Frequently a sobriquet is given by no means
complimentary. All of the subsequently acquired, as well as the original
names, are connected with material objects or with substantive actions
so as to be expressible in a graphic picture, and, therefore, in a
pictorial sign. The determination to use names of this connotive
character is shown by the objective translation, whenever possible, of
those European names which it became necessary to introduce into their
speech. William Penn was called “Onas,” that being the word for
feather-quill in the Mohawk dialect. The name of the second French
governor of Canada was “Montmagny” which was translated by the Iroquois
“Onontio”&mdash;“Great Mountain,” and becoming associated with the
title, has been applied to all successive Canadian governors, though the
origin being
<span class = "pagenum">366</span>
<a name = "page366" id = "page366"> </a>
generally forgotten, it has been considered as a metaphorical
compliment. It is also said that Governor Fletcher was not named by the
Iroquois “Cajenquiragoe,” “the great swift arrow,” because of his speedy
arrival at a critical time, but because they had somehow been informed
of the etymology of his name&mdash;“arrow maker” (<i>Fr.</i>
<i>fléchier</i>).</p>

<h5>GENDER.</h5>

<p>This is sometimes expressed by different signs to distinguish the sex
of animals, when the difference in appearance allows of such varied
portraiture. An example is in the signs for the male and female buffalo,
given by the Prince of Wied. The former is, “Place the tightly closed
hands on both sides of the head, with the fingers forward;” the latter
is, “Curve the two forefingers, place them on the sides of the head and
move them several times.” The short stubby horns of the bull appear to
be indicated, and the cow’s ears are seen moving, not being covered by
the bull’s shock mane. Tribes in which the hair of the women is
differently arranged from that of men often denote their females by
corresponding gesture. In many cases the sex of animals is indicated by
the addition of a generic sign for male or female.</p>

<h5>TENSE.</h5>

<p>While it has been mentioned that there is no inflection of signs to
express tense, yet the conception of present, past, and future is
gestured without difficulty. A&nbsp;common mode of indicating the
present time is by the use of signs for <i>to-day</i>, one of which is,
“(1)&nbsp;both hands extended, palms outward; (2)&nbsp;swept slowly
forward and to each side, to convey the idea of openness.”
(<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.) This may combine the idea of <i>now</i> with
<i>openness</i>, the first part of it resembling the general deaf-mute
sign for <i>here</i> or <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>Two signs nearly related together are also reported as expressing the
meaning <i>now, at once</i>, viz.: “Forefinger of the right hand
extended, upright, &amp;c. (J), is carried upward in front of the right
side of the body and above the head so that the extended finger points
toward the center of the heavens, and then carried downward in front of
the right breast, forefinger still pointing upright.”
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.) “Place the extended index, pointing upward, palm
to the left, as high as and before the top of the head; push the hand up
and down a slight distance several times, the eyes being directed upward
at the time.” (<i>Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I;
<i>Arikara</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i>&nbsp;II;
<i>Wichita</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Time past is not only expressed, but some tribes give a distinct
modification to show a short or long time past. The following are
examples:</p>

<p><i>Lately, recently</i>.&mdash;Hold the left hand at arm’s length,
closed, with forefinger only extended and pointing in the direction of
the place where the event occurred; then hold the right hand against the
right shoulder, closed, but with index extended and pointing in the
direction of the left. The hands may be exchanged, the right extended
and the left retained,
<span class = "pagenum">367</span>
<a name = "page367" id = "page367"> </a>
as the case may require for ease in description.
(<i>Absaroka</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Shoshoni and Banak</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p><i>Long ago</i>.&mdash;Both hands closed, forefingers extended and
straight; pass one hand slowly at arm’s length, pointing horizontally,
the other against the shoulder or near it, pointing in the same
direction as the opposite one. Frequently the tips of the forefingers
are placed together, and the hands drawn apart, until they reach the
positions described. (<i>Absaroka</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Shoshoni and
Banak</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The Comanche, Wichita, and other Indians designate a <i>short time
ago</i> by placing the tips of the forefinger and thumb of the left hand
together, the remaining fingers closed, and holding the hand before the
body with forefinger and thumb pointing toward the right shoulder; the
index and thumb of the right hand are then similarly held and placed
against those of the left, when the hands are slowly drawn apart a short
distance. For a <i>long time ago</i> the hands are similarly held, but
drawn farther apart. Either of these signs may be and frequently is
preceded by those for <i>day, month</i>, or <i>year</i>, when it is
desired to convey a definite idea of the time past.</p>

<p>A sign is reported with the abstract idea of <i>future</i>, as
follows: “The arms are flexed and hands brought together in front of the
body as in type-position (W). The hands are made to move in wave-like
motions up and down together and from side to side.”
(<i>Oto</i>&nbsp;I.) The authority gives the poetical conception of
“Floating on the tide of time.”</p>

<p>The ordinary mode of expressing future time is, however, by some
figurative reference, as the following: Count off fingers, then shut all
the fingers of both hands several times, and touch the hair and tent or
other white object. (<i>Apache</i> III.) “Many years; when I am old
(whitehaired).”</p>

<h5>CONJUNCTIONS.</h5>

<p>An interesting instance where the rapid connection of signs has the
effect of the conjunction <i>and</i> is shown in <span class =
"smallcaps">Nátci’s Narrative</span>, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<h5>PREPOSITIONS.</h5>

<p>In the <span class = "smallcaps">Tendoy-Huerito Dialogue</span> (page
489) the combination of gestures supplies the want of the proposition
<i>to</i>.</p>

<h5>PUNCTUATION.</h5>

<p>While this is generally accompanied by facial expression, manner of
action, or pause, instances have been noticed suggesting the device of
interrogation points and periods.</p>

<p class = "center"><i>Mark of interrogation.</i></p>

<p>The Shoshoni, Absaroka, Dakota, Comanche, and other Indians, when
desiring to ask a question, precede the gestures constituting the
information desired by a sign intended to attract attention and “asking
for,” viz., by holding the flat right hand, with the palm down, directed
to the
<span class = "pagenum">368</span>
<a name = "page368" id = "page368"> </a>
individual interrogated, with or without lateral oscillating motion; the
gestural sentence, when completed, being closed by the same sign and a
look of inquiry. This recalls the Spanish use of the interrogation
points before and after the question.</p>

<p class = "center"><i>Period.</i></p>

<p>A Hidatsa, after concluding a short statement, indicated its
conclusion by placing the inner edges of the clinched hands together
before the breast, and passing them outward and downward to their
respective sides in an emphatic manner, <a href = "#fig334">Fig.
334</a>, page 528. This sign is also used in other connections to
express <i>done</i>.</p>

<p>The same mode of indicating the close of a narrative or statement is
made by the Wichitas, by holding the extended left hand horizontally
before the body, fingers pointing to the right, palm either toward the
body or downward, and cutting edgewise downward past the tips of the
left with the extended right hand. This is the same sign given in the
<span class = "smallcaps">Address Of Kin Chē-ĕss</span> as <i>cut
off</i>, and is illustrated in <a href = "#fig324">Fig. 324</a>, page
522. This is more ideographic and convenient than the device of the
Abyssinian Galla, reported by M.&nbsp;A. d’Abbadie, who denoted a comma
by a slight stroke of a leather whip, a&nbsp;semicolon by a harder one,
and a full stop by one still harder.</p>

GESTURES AIDING ARCHÆOLOGIC RESEARCH.</a></h4>

<p>The most interesting light in which the Indians of North America can
be regarded is in their present representation of a stage of evolution
once passed through by our own ancestors. Their signs, as well as their
myths and customs, form a part of the paleontology of humanity to be
studied in the history of the latter as the geologist, with similar
object, studies all the strata of the physical world. At this time it is
only possible to suggest the application of gesture signs to elucidate
pictographs, and also their examination to discover religious,
sociologic, and historic ideas preserved in them, as has been done with
great success in the radicals of oral speech.</p>

<h5>SIGNS CONNECTED WITH PICTOGRAPHS.</h5>

<p>The picture writing of Indians is the sole form in which they
recorded events and ideas that can ever be interpreted without the aid
of a traditional key, such as is required for the signification of the
wampum belts of the Northeastern tribes and the <i>quippus</i> of Peru.
Strips of bark, tablets of wood, dressed skins of animals, and the
smooth surfaces of rock have been and still are used for such records,
those most ancient, and therefore most interesting, being of course the
rock etchings; but they can only be deciphered, if at all, by the
ascertained principles on which the more modern and the more obvious are
made. Many of the numerous and widespread rock carvings are mere idle
sketches of natural objects, mainly animals, and others are as
exclusively
<span class = "pagenum">369</span>
<a name = "page369" id = "page369"> </a>
mnemonic as the wampum above mentioned. Even since the Columbian
discovery some tribes have employed devices yet ruder than the rudest
pictorial attempt as markers for the memory. An account of one of these
is given in E.&nbsp;Winslow’s Relation (A.D. 1624), <i>Col. Mass. Hist.
Soc.</i>, 2d series, ix, 1822, p.&nbsp;99, as follows:</p>

<p>“Instead of records and chronicles they take this course: Where any
remarkable act is done, in memory of it, either in the place or by some
pathway near adjoining, they make a round hole in the ground about a
foot deep, and as much over, which, when others passing by behold, they
inquire the cause and occasion of the same, which being once known, they
are careful to acquaint all men as occasion serveth therewith. And lest
such holes should be filled or grown over by any accident, as men pass
by they will often renew the same; by which means many things of great
antiquity are fresh in memory. So that as a man traveleth, if he can
understand his guide, his journey will be the less tedious, by reason of
the many historical discourses which will be related unto him.”</p>

<p>Gregg, in <i>Commerce of the Prairies</i>, <i>New York</i>, 1844, II,
286, says of the Plains tribes: “When traveling, they will also pile
heaps of stones upon mounds or conspicuous points, so arranged as to be
understood by their passing comrades; and sometimes they set up the
bleached buffalo heads, which are everywhere scattered over those
plains, to indicate the direction of their march, and many other facts
which may be communicated by those simple signs.”</p>

</div>

<p>A more ingenious but still arbitrary mode of giving intelligence is
practiced at this day by the Abnaki, as reported by H.&nbsp;L. Masta,
chief of that tribe, now living at Pierreville, Quebec. When they are in
the woods, to say “I&nbsp;am going to the east,” a&nbsp;stick is stuck
in the ground pointing to that direction, Fig. 151. “Am not gone far,”
another stick is stuck across the former, close to the ground, Fig. 152.
“Gone far” is the reverse, Fig. 153. The number of days journey of
proposed absence is shown by the same number of sticks across the first;
thus Fig. 154 signifies five days’ journey. Cutting the bark off from a
tree on one, two, three or four sides near the butt means “Have had
poor, poorer, poorest luck.” Cutting it off all around the tree means
“I&nbsp;am starving.” Smoking a piece of birch bark and hanging it on a
tree means “I&nbsp;am sick.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">370</span>
<a name = "page370" id = "page370"> </a>
<p>Where there has existed any form of artistic representation, however
rude, and at the same time a system of ideographic gesture signs
prevailed, it would be expected that the form of the latter would appear
in the former. The sign of <i>river</i> and <i>water</i> mentioned on
page 358 being established, when it became necessary or desirable to
draw a character or design to convey the same idea, nothing would be
more natural than to use the graphic form of delineation which is also
above described. It was but one more and an easy step to fasten upon
bark, skins, or rocks the evanescent air pictures that still in pigments
or carvings preserve their skeleton outline, and in their ideography
approach, as has been shown above, the rudiments of the phonetic
alphabets that have been constructed by other peoples. A&nbsp;transition
stage between gestures and pictographs, in which the left hand is used
as a supposed drafting surface upon which the index draws lines, is
exhibited in the <span class = "smallcaps">Dialogue between Alaskan
Indians</span>, <i>infra</i>, page 498. This device is common among
deaf-mutes, without equal archæologic importance, as it may have been
suggested by the art of writing, with which they are generally
acquainted, even if not instructed in it.</p>

<p>The reproduction of apparent gesture lines in the pictographs made by
our Indians has, for obvious reasons, been most frequent in the attempt
to convey those subjective ideas which were beyond the range of an
artistic skill limited to the direct representation of objects, so that
the part of the pictographs which is still the most difficult of
interpretation is precisely the one which the study of sign language is
likely to elucidate. The following examples of pictographs of the
Indians, in some cases compared with those from foreign sources, have
been selected because their interpretation is definitely known and the
gestures corresponding with or suggested by them are well
determined.</p>

<p>The common Indian gesture sign for <i>sun</i> is: “Right hand closed,
the index and thumb curved, with tips touching, thus approximating a
circle, and held toward the sky,” the position of the fingers of the
hand forming a circle being shown in Fig. 155. Two of the Egyptian
characters for <i>sun</i>, Figs. 156 and 157, are plainly the universal
conception of the disk. The latter, together with indications of rays,
Fig. 158, and in its linear form, Fig. 159, (Champollion,
<i>Dict.</i>,&nbsp;9),
<span class = "pagenum">371</span>

constitutes the Egyptian character for <i>light</i>. The rays emanating

of the United States Geological Survey, from the rock etchings of the
Moqui pueblos in Arizona. The same authority gives from the same

from several other similar etchings for <i>star</i> also given by him,
Figs. 164, 165, 166, 167, by always showing some indication of a face,
the latter being absent in the characters denoting <i>star</i>.</p>

<p>A gesture sign for <i>sunrise, morning</i>, is: Forefinger of right
hand crooked to represent half of the sun’s disk and pointed or extended
to the left, then slightly elevated. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.) In this
connection it may be noted that when the gesture is carefully made in
open country the pointing would generally be to the east, and the body
turned so that its left would be in that direction. In a room in a city,
or under circumstances where the points of the compass are not specially
attended to, the left side supposes the east, and the gestures relating
to sun, day, &amp;c., are made with such reference. The half only of the
disk represented in the above gesture appears in the following Moqui
pueblo etchings for <i>morning</i> and <i>sunrise</i>, Figs. 170, 171,
and 172. (Gilbert, <i>MS.</i>)</p>

passing the index from east to west across the zenith. This curve is
apparent in the Ojibwa pictograph Fig. 178, reported in Schoolcraft, I,

<p>A sign for <i>cloud</i> is as follows: (1) Both hands partially
closed, palms facing and near each other, brought up to level with or

repeated for “many clouds.” (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.) The same

<p>A common sign for <i>speech, speak</i>, among the Indians is the
repeated motion of the index in a straight line forward from the mouth.
This line, indicating the voice, is shown in Fig. 190, taken from the
<i>Dakota Calendar</i>, being the expression for the fact that
“the-Elk-that-hollows-walking,” a&nbsp;Minneconjou chief, “made
medicine.”
<span class = "pagenum">374</span>

The ceremony is indicated by the head of an albino buffalo. A&nbsp;more
graphic portraiture of the conception of <i>voice</i> is in Fig. 191,
representing an antelope and the whistling sound produced by the animal
on being surprised or alarmed. This is taken from MS. drawing book of an
Indian prisoner at Saint Augustine, Fla., now in the Smithsonian
Institution, No. 30664.</p>

<p>Fig. 192 is the exhibition of wrestling for a turkey, the point of

<p>The wrestlers, according to the foot prints, had evidently come
together, when, meeting the returning hunter, who is wrapped in his
blanket with only one foot protruding, they separated and threw off
their blankets, leggings, and moccasins, both endeavoring to win the
turkey, which lies between them and the donor.</p>

<p>In Fig. 193, taken from the same MS. drawing book, the conversation
is about the lassoing, shooting, and final killing of a buffalo which
has wandered to a camp. The dotted lines indicate footprints. The Indian
drawn under the buffalo having secured the animal by the fore feet, so
informs his companions, as indicated by the line drawn from his mouth to
the object mentioned; the left-hand figure, having also secured the
buffalo by the horns, gives his nearest comrade an opportunity to strike
it with an ax, which he no
<span class = "pagenum">375</span>

doubt announces that he will do, as the line from his mouth to the head
of the animal suggests. The Indian in the upper left-hand corner is told
by a squaw to take an arrow and join his companions, when he turns his
head to inform her that he has one already, which fact he demonstrates
by holding up the weapon.</p>

flat right hand, palm upward, about fifteen inches in front of the right
side of the face, fingers pointing to the left and front; then draw the
hand inward toward and against the bottom of the chin. For
<i>conversation</i>, talking between two persons, both hands are held
before the breast, pointing forward, palms up, the edges being moved
several times toward one another. Perhaps, however, the picture in fact
only means the common poetical image of “flying words.”</p>

<p>The natural sign for <i>hear</i>, made both by Indians and
deaf-mutes, consisting in the motion of the index, or the index and
thumb joined, in a straight line to the ear, is illustrated in the
Ojibwa pictograph Fig. 196, “hearing ears,” and those of the same
people, Figs. 197 and 198, the latter of which is a hearing serpent, and
the former means “I&nbsp;hear, but your words are from a bad heart,” the
hands being thrown out as in the final part of a gesture for <i>bad
heart</i>, which is made by the hand being closed and held near the
breast, with the back toward the breast, then as the arm is suddenly
extended the hand is opened and the fingers separated from each other.
(<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.) The final part of the gesture,

<p>The typical sign for <i>kill</i> or <i>killed</i> is: Right hand
clinched, thumb lying along finger tips, elevated to near the shoulder,
strike downward and outward vaguely in the direction of the object to be
killed. The abbreviated sign is simply to clinch the right hand in the
manner described and strike it down and out from the right side.

Fig. 53, found in the Wind River Valley, Wyoming Territory, was
interpreted by members of a Shoshoni and Banak delegation to Washington
in 1880 as “an Indian killed another.” The latter is very roughly
delineated in the horizontal figure, but is also represented by the line
under the hand of the upright figure, meaning the same individual. At

warrior’s rank. The arm nearest the prostrate foe shows the gesture for

<p>Fig. 204, from the same locality and authority, was also interpreted
by the Shoshoni and Banak. It appears from their description that a
Blackfoot had attacked the habitation of some of his own people. The
right-hand upper figure represents his horse with the lance suspended
from the side. The lower figure illustrates the log house built against
a stream. The dots are the prints of the horse’s hoofs, while the two
lines running outward from the upper inclosure show that two thrusts of
the lance were made over the wall of the house, thus killing the
occupant and securing two bows and five arrows, as represented in the
left-hand group. The right-hand figure of that group shows the hand
raised in the attitude of making the gesture for <i>kill</i>.</p>

<p>The Menomoni Indians now begin their prayers by raising their hands
in the same manner. They may have been influenced in this respect by the
attitudes of their missionaries in prayer and benediction. The Apaches,
who have received less civilized tuition, in a religious gesture
corresponding with prayer spread their hands opposite the face, palms up
and backward, apparently expressing the desire to <i>receive</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 206 is a copy of an Egyptian tablet reproduced from Cooper’s
<i>Serpent Myths</i>, page 28. A&nbsp;priest kneels before the great
goddess Ranno, while supplicating her favor. The conception of the
author is that the hands are raised by the supplicant to shield his face
from the glory of the divinity. It may be compared with signs for asking
for <i>mercy</i> and for giving mercy to another, the former being:
Extend both forefingers, pointing upward, palms toward the breast, and
hold the hands before the chest; then draw them inward toward their
respective sides, and pass them upward as high as the sides of the head
by either cheek.

(<i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i>&nbsp;II;
<i>Wichita</i>&nbsp;II.) The latter, <i>to have mercy on another</i>, as
made by the same tribes, is: Hold both hands nearly side by side before
the chest, palms forward, forefinger only extended and pointing upward;
then move them forward and upward, as if passing them by the cheeks of
another person from the breast to the sides of the head.</p>

<p>Fig. 211 is an Ojibwa pictograph taken from Schoolcraft, <i>loc.

spiral may be collated Fig. 212 which portrays the ram-headed Egyptian
god Knuphis, or Chnum, the spirit, in a shrine on the boat of the sun,
canopied by the serpent-goddess Ranno, who is also seen facing him
inside the shrine. This is reproduced from Cooper’s <i>Serpent

<p>Fig. 215 is also an Ojibwa pictograph from Schoolcraft I, pl. 59, and

Combined with the sign for <i>sky</i>, before given, page 372, it means
knowledge of superior matters; spiritual power.</p>

<p>The common sign for <i>trade</i> is made by extending the
forefingers, holding them obliquely upward, and crossing them at right
angles to one another, usually in front of the chest. This is often
abbreviated by merely crossing the forefingers, see <a href =
"#fig278">Fig. 278</a>, page 452. It is illustrated in Fig. 216, taken

<p>To this the following explanation is given: “The cross signifies,
‘I&nbsp;will barter or trade.’ Three animals are drawn on the right hand
of the cross; one is a buffalo; the two others, a&nbsp;weasel
(<i>Mustela Canadensis</i>) and an otter. The writer offers in exchange
for the skins of these animals (probably meaning that of a white
buffalo) the articles which he has drawn on the left side of the cross.
He has, in the first place, depicted a beaver very plainly, behind which
there is a gun; to the left of the beaver are thirty strokes, each ten

formed either by the opposed thumbs and forefingers of both hands or by
a circular motion of both hands, palms inward, toward each other. In

<p>If no gesture is actually included in all of the foregoing
pictographs, it is seen that a gesture sign is made with the same
conception which is obvious in the ideographic pictures. They are
selected as specially transparent and clear. Many others less distinct
are now the subject of examination for elucidation. The following
examples are added to show the ideographic style of pictographs not
connected with gestures, lest it may be suspected that an attempt is
made to prove that gestures are always included in or connected with
them. Fig. 224, from the <i>Dakota Calendar</i>, refers to the small-pox
which broke out in the year (1802) which it specifies. Fig. 225 shows in
the design at the left, a&nbsp;warning or notice, that though a goat can
climb up the rocky trail a horse will tumble&mdash;“No Thoroughfare.”

</div>

<p>The Prince of Wied gives in his list of signs the heading
<i>Partisan</i>, a term of the Canadian voyageurs, signifying a leader
of an occasional or volunteer war party, the sign being reported as
follows: Make first the sign of the pipe, afterwards open the thumb and
index-finger of the right hand, back of the hand outward, and move it
forward and upward in a curve. This is explained by the author’s account
in a different connection, that to become recognized as a leader of such
a war party as above mentioned, the first act among the tribes using the
sign was the consecration, by fasting succeeded by feasting, of a
medicine pipe without ornament, which the leader of the expedition
afterward bore before him as his badge of authority, and it therefore
naturally became an emblematic sign. This sign with its interpretation
supplies a meaning to Fig. 226 from the <i>Dakota Calendar</i> showing
“One Feather,” a&nbsp;Sioux chief who raised in that year a large war
party against the Crows, which fact is simply denoted by his holding out
demonstratively an unornamented pipe. In connection with this subject,
Fig. 227, drawn and explained by Two Strike, an Ogalala Dakota, relating
to his own achievements, displays four plain pipes to exhibit the fact
that he had led four war parties.</p>

<p>The sign of the pipe or of smoking is made in a different manner,
when used to mean <i>friend</i>, as follows: (1)&nbsp;Tips of the two
first fingers of the right hand placed against or at right angles to the
mouth; (2)&nbsp;suddenly elevated upward and outward to imitate smoke
expelled. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.) “We two smoke together.” This is

<p>A ceremonial sign for <i>peace, friendship</i>, is the extended
fingers, separated (R), interlocked in front of the breast, hands
horizontal, backs outward. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.) Fig. 229 from the
<i>Dakota Calendar</i> exhibits the beginning of this gesture. When the
idea conveyed
<span class = "pagenum">385</span>
<a name = "page385" id = "page385"> </a>
is peace or friendship with the whites, the hand shaking of the latter
is adopted as in Fig. 230, also taken from the <i>Dakota Calendar</i>,
and referring to the peace made in 1855 by General Harney, at Fort
Pierre, with a number of the tribes of the Dakotas.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that while the ceremonial gesture of uniting or
linking hands is common and ancient in token of peace, the practice of
shaking hands on meeting, now the annoying etiquette of the Indians in
their intercourse with whites, was not until very recently and is even
now seldom used by them between each other, and is clearly a foreign
importation. Their fancy for affectionate greeting was in giving a
pleasant bodily sensation by rubbing each other on the breast, abdomen,
and limbs, or by a hug. The senseless and inconvenient custom of shaking
hands is, indeed, by no means general throughout the world, and in the
extent to which it prevails in the United States is a subject of
ridicule by foreigners. The Chinese, with a higher conception of
politeness, shake their own hands. The account of a recent observer of
the meeting of two polite Celestials is: “Each placed the fingers of one
hand over the fist of the other, so that the thumbs met, and then
standing a few feet apart raised his hands gently up and down in front
of his breast. For special courtesy, after the foregoing gesture, they
place the hand which had been the actor in it on the stomach of its
owner, not on that part of the interlocutor, the whole proceeding being
subjective, but perhaps a relic of objective performance.” In Miss
Bird’s <i>Unbeaten Trades in Japan</i>, <i>London</i>, 1880, the
following is given as the salutatory etiquette of that empire: “As
acquaintances come in sight of each other they slacken their pace and
approach with downcast eyes and averted faces as if neither were worthy
of beholding each other; then they bow low, so low as to bring the face,
still kept carefully averted, on a level with the knees, on which the
palms of the hands are pressed. Afterwards, during the friendly strife
of each to give the <i>pas</i> to the other, the palms of the hands are
diligently rubbed against each other.”</p>

<p>The interlocking of the fingers of both hands above given as an
Indian sign (other instances being mentioned under the head of <span
class = "smallcaps">Signals</span>, <i>infra</i>) is also reported by
R.&nbsp;Brough Smyth, <i>Aborigines of Victoria</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>,
Vol. II, p.&nbsp;308, as made by the natives of Cooper’s Creek,
Australia, to express the highest degree of friendship, including a
special form of hospitality in which the wives of the entertainer
performed a part. Fig. 231 is reproduced from a cut in the work referred
to.</p>

<p>But besides this interlocked form of signifying the union of
friendship the hands are frequently grasped together. Sometimes the sign
is abbreviated by simply extending the hand as if about to grasp that of
another, and sometimes the two forefingers are laid side by side, which
last sign also means, <i>same, brother</i> and <i>companion</i>. For
description and
<span class = "pagenum">386</span>
<a name = "page386" id = "page386"> </a>
illustration of these three signs, see respectively pages 521, 527, and
317. A&nbsp;different execution of the same conception of union or
linking to signify <i>friend</i> is often made as follows: Hook the
curved index over the curved forefinger of the left hand, the palm of
the latter pointing forward, the palm of the right hand being turned
toward the face; remaining fingers and thumbs being closed.
(<i>Dakota</i> VIII.) Fig. 232.</p>

<p>Wied’s sign for medicine is “Stir with the right hand into the left,
and afterward blow into the latter.” All persons familiar with the
Indians will understand that the term “medicine,” foolishly enough
adopted by both French and English to express the aboriginal magic arts,
has no therapeutic significance. Very few even pretended remedies were
administered to the natives and probably never by the professional
shaman, who worked by incantation, often pulverizing and mixing the
substances mystically used, to prevent their detection. The same
mixtures were employed in divination. The author particularly mentions
Mandan ceremonies, in which a white “medicine” stone, as hard as
pyrites, was produced by rubbing in the hand snow or the white feathers
of a bird. The blowing away of the disease, considered to be introduced
by a supernatural power foreign to the body, was a common part of the
juggling performance.</p>

<p>A sign for <i>stone</i> is as follows: With the back of the arched
right hand (H) strike repeatedly in the palm of the left, held
horizontal, back outward, at the height of the breast and about a foot
in front; the ends of the fingers point in opposite directions.
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.) From its use when the stone was the only
hammer.</p>

<p>A suggestive sign for <i>knife</i> is reported, viz: Cut past the
mouth with the raised right hand. (<i>Wied</i>.) This probably refers to
the general practice of cutting off food, as much being crammed into the
mouth as can be managed and then separated from the remaining mass by a
stroke of a knife. This is specially the usage with fat and entrails,
the Indian delicacies.</p>

<p>An old sign for <i>tomahawk, ax</i>, is as follows: Cross the arms
and slide the edge of the right hand, held vertically, down over the
left arm. (<i>Wied</i>.) This is still employed, at least for a small
hatchet, or “dress tomahawk,” and would be unintelligible without
special knowledge. The essential point is laying the extended right hand
in the bend of the left elbow. The sliding down over the left arm is an
almost unavoidable but quite unnecessary accompaniment to the sign,
which indicates the way in which the hatchet is usually carried. Pipes,
whips, bows and arrows, fans, and other dress or emblematic articles of
the “buck” are seldom or never carried in the bend of the left elbow as
is the ax. The pipe is usually held in the left hand.</p>

<p>The following sign for <i>Indian village</i> is given by Wied: Place
the open thumb and forefinger of each hand opposite to each other, as if
to
<span class = "pagenum">387</span>
<a name = "page387" id = "page387"> </a>
make a circle, but leaving between them a small interval; afterward move
them from above downward simultaneously. The villages of the tribes with
which the author was longest resident, particularly the Mandans and
Arikaras, were surrounded by a strong circular stockade, spaces or
breaks in the circle being left for entrance or exit.</p>

<p>Signs for <i>dog</i> are made by some of the tribes of the plains
essentially the same as the following: Extend and spread the right<ins
class = "correction" title = "punctuation unchanged">, </ins>fore, and
middle fingers, and draw the hand about eighteen inches from left to
right across the front of the body at the height of the navel, palm
downward, fingers pointing toward the left and a little downward, little
and ring fingers to be loosely closed, the thumb against the
ring-finger. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.) The sign would not be intelligible
without knowledge of the fact that before the introduction of the horse,
and even yet, the dog has been used to draw the tent- or lodge-poles in
moving camp, and the sign represents the trail. Indians less nomadic,
who built more substantial lodges, and to whom the material for poles
was less precious than on the plains, would not have comprehended this
sign without such explanation as is equivalent to a translation from a
foreign language, and the more general one is the palm lowered as if to
stroke gently in a line conforming to the animal’s head and neck. It is
abbreviated by simply lowering the hand to the usual height of the
wolfish aboriginal breed, and suggests <i>the</i> animal <i>par
excellence</i> domesticated by the Indians and made a companion.</p>

NOTABLE POINTS FOR FURTHER RESEARCHES.</a></h3>

<p>It is considered desirable to indicate some points to which for
special reasons the attention of collaborators for the future
publication on the general subject of sign language may be invited.
These now follow:</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_notable_invention" id = "sign_notable_invention">
INVENTION OF NEW SIGNS.</a></h4>

<p>It is probable that signs will often be invented by individual
Indians who may be pressed for them by collectors to express certain
ideas, which signs of course form no part of any current language; but
while that fact should, if possible, be ascertained and reported, the
signs so invented are not valueless merely because they are original and
not traditional, if they are made in good faith and in accordance with
the principles of sign formation. Less error will arise in this
direction than from the misinterpretation of the idea intended to be
conveyed by spontaneous signs. The process resembles the coining of new
words to which the higher languages owe their copiousness. It is
observed in the signs
<span class = "pagenum">388</span>
<a name = "page388" id = "page388"> </a>
invented by Indians for each new product of civilization brought to
their notice.</p>

<p>An interesting instance is in the sign for <i>steamboat</i>, made at
the request of the writer by White Man (who, however, did not like that
sobriquet and announced his intention to change his name to Lean Bear),
an Apache, in June, 1880, who had a few days before seen a steamboat for
the first time. After thinking a moment he gave an original sign,
described as follows:</p>

<p>Make the sign for <i>water</i>, by placing the flat right hand before
the face, pointing upward and forward, the back forward, with the wrist
as high as the nose; then draw it down and inward toward the chin; then
with both hands indicate the outlines of a horizontal oval figure from
before the body back to near the chest (being the outline of the deck);
then place both flat hands, pointing forward, thumbs higher than the
outer edges, and push them forward to arms’-length (illustrating the
powerful forward motion of the vessel).</p>

<p>An original sign for <i>telegraph</i> is given in <span class =
"smallcaps">Natci’s Narrative</span>, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>An Indian skilled in signs, as also a deaf-mute, at the sight of a
new object, or at the first experience of some new feeling or mental
relation, will devise some mode of expressing it in pantomimic gesture
or by a combination of previously understood signs, which will be
intelligible to others, similarly skilled, provided that they have seen
the same objects or have felt the same emotions. But if a number of such
Indians or deaf-mutes were to see an object&mdash;for instance an
elephant&mdash;for the first time, each would perhaps hit upon a
different sign, in accordance with the characteristic appearance most
striking to him. That animal’s trunk is generally the most attractive
lineament to deaf-mutes, who make a sign by pointing to the nose and
moving the arm as the trunk is moved. Others regard the long tusks as
the most significant feature, while others are struck by the large head
and small eyes. This diversity of conception brings to mind the poem of
“The Blind Men and the Elephant,” which with true philosophy in an
amusing guise explains how the sense of touch led the “six men of
Indostan” severally to liken the animal to a wall, spear, snake, tree,
fan, and rope. A&nbsp;consideration of invented or original signs, as
showing the operation of the mind of an Indian or other uncivilized
gesturer, has a psychologic interest, and as connected with the vocal
expression, often also invented at the same time, has further value.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_notable_symbolic" id = "sign_notable_symbolic">
DANGER OF SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION.</a></h4>

<p>In the examination of sign language it is important to form a clear
distinction between signs proper and symbols. The terms signs and
symbols are often used interchangeably, but with liability to
misconstruction, as many persons, whether with right or wrong lexical
definition, ascribe to symbols an occult and mystic signification. All
characters in Indian picture-writing have been loosely styled symbols,
and, as there is no logical distinction between the characters impressed
with
<span class = "pagenum">389</span>
<a name = "page389" id = "page389"> </a>
enduring form and when merely outlined in the ambient air, all Indian
gestures, motions, and attitudes might with equal appropriateness be
called symbolic. While, however, all symbols come under the generic head
of signs, very few signs are in accurate classification symbols.
S.&nbsp;T. Coleridge has defined a symbol to be a sign included in the
idea it represents. This may be intelligible if it is intended that an
ordinary sign is extraneous to the concept and, rather than suggested by
it, is invented to express it by some representation or analogy, while a
symbol may be evolved by a process of thought from the concept itself;
but it is no very exhaustive or practically useful distinction. Symbols
are less obvious and more artificial than mere signs, require
convention, are not only abstract, but metaphysical, and often need
explanation from history, religion, and customs. They do not depict but
suggest subjects; do not speak directly through the eye to the
intelligence, but presuppose in the mind knowledge of an event or fact
which the sign recalls. The symbols of the ark, dove, olive branch, and
rainbow would be wholly meaningless to people unfamiliar with the Mosaic
or some similar cosmology, as would be the cross and the crescent to
those ignorant of history. The last named objects appeared in the class
of <i>emblems</i> when used in designating the conflicting powers of
Christendom and Islamism. Emblems do not necessarily require any analogy
between the objects representing, and the objects or qualities
represented, but may arise from pure accident. After a scurrilous jest
the beggar’s wallet became the emblem of the confederated nobles, the
Gueux of the Netherlands; and a sling, in the early minority of Louis
XIV, was adopted from the refrain of a song by the Frondeur opponents of
Mazarin. The portraiture of a fish, used, especially by the early
Christians, for the name and title of Jesus Christ was still more
accidental, being, in the Greek word <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "ichthus">ἰχθύς</span>, an acrostic composed of the initials of
the several Greek words signifying that name and title. This origin
being unknown to persons whose religious enthusiasm was as usual in
direct proportion to their ignorance, they expended much rhetoric to
prove that there was some true symbolic relation between an actual fish
and the Saviour of men. Apart from this misapplication, the fish
undoubtedly became an emblem of Christ and of Christianity, appearing
frequently on the Roman catacombs and at one time it was used
hermeneutically.</p>

<p>The several tribal signs for the Sioux, Arapahos, Cheyennes, &amp;c.,
are their emblems precisely as the star-spangled flag is that of the
United States, but there is nothing symbolic in any of them. So the
signs for individual chiefs, when not merely translations of their
names, are emblematic of their family totems or personal distinctions,
and are no more symbols than are the distinctive shoulder-straps of army
officers. The <i>crux ansata</i> and the circle formed by a snake biting
its tail are symbols, but <i>consensus</i> as well as invention was
necessary for their establishment, and the Indians have produced nothing
so esoteric, nothing which they intended for hermeneutic as distinct
from descriptive or mnemonic purposes.
<span class = "pagenum">390</span>
<a name = "page390" id = "page390"> </a>
Sign language can undoubtedly be and is employed to express highly
metaphysical ideas, but to do that in a symbolic system requires a
development of the mode of expression consequent upon a similar
development of the mental idiocrasy of the gesturers far beyond any yet
found among historic tribes north of Mexico. A&nbsp;very few of their
signs may at first appear to be symbolic, yet even those on closer
examination will probably be relegated to the class of emblems.</p>

<p>The point urged is that while many signs can be used as emblems and
both can be converted by convention into symbols or be explained as such
by perverted ingenuity, it is futile to seek for that form of
psychologic exuberance in the stage of development attained by the
tribes now under consideration. All predetermination to interpret either
their signs or their pictographs on the principles of symbolism as
understood or pretended to be understood by its admirers, and as are
sometimes properly applied to Egyptian hieroglyphs, results in mooning
mysticism. This was shown by a correspondent who enthusiastically lauded
the <i>Dakota Calendar</i> (edited by the present writer, and which is a
mere figuration of successive occurrences in the history of the people),
as a numerical exposition of the great doctrines of the Sun religion in
the equations of time, and proved to his own satisfaction that our
Indians preserved hermeneutically the lost geometric cultus of
pre-Cushite scientists.</p>

<p>Another exhibition of this vicious practice was recently made in the
interpretation of an inscribed stone alleged to have been unearthed near
Zanesville, Ohio. Two of the characters were supposed, in liberal
exercise of the imagination, to represent the <span class = "greek" lang
= "el" title = "Alpha">Α</span> and <span class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "Omega">Ω</span> of the Greek alphabet. At the comparatively
late date when the arbitrary arrangement of the letters of that alphabet
had become fixed, the initial and concluding letters might readily have
been used to represent respectively the beginning and the end of any
series or number of things, and this figure of speech was employed in
the book of Revelations. In the attempted interpretation of the
inscription mentioned, which was hawked about to many scientific bodies,
and published over the whole country, the supposed alpha and omega were
assumed to constitute a universal as well as sacred symbol for the
everlasting Creator. The usual <i>menu</i> of Roman feasts, commencing
with eggs and ending with apples, was also commonly known at the time
when the book of Revelations was written, and the phrase “<i>ab ovo
usque ad mala</i>” was as appropriate as “from alpha to omega” to
express “from the beginning to the end.” In deciphering the stone it
would, therefore, be as correct in principle to take one of its oval and
one of its round figures, call them egg and apple, and make them the
symbols of eternity. In fact, not depending wholly for significance upon
the order of courses of a feast or the accident of alphabetical
position, but having intrinsic characteristics in reference to the
origin and fruition of life, the egg and apple translation would be more
acceptable to the general judgment, and it is recommended to enthusiasts
who insist on finding symbols where none exist.</p>

<h4><a name = "sign_notable_women" id = "sign_notable_women">
SIGNS USED BY WOMEN AND CHILDREN.</a></h4>

<p>For reasons before given it is important to ascertain the varying
extent of familiarity with sign language among the members of the
several tribes, how large a proportion possesses any skill in it, and
the average amount of their vocabulary. It is also of special interest
to learn the degree to which women become proficient, and the age at
which children commence its practice; also whether they receive
systematic instruction in it. The statement was made by Titchkemátski
that the Kaiowa and Comanche women know nothing of sign language, while
the Cheyenne women are versed in it. As he is a Cheyenne, however, he
may not have a large circle of feminine acquaintances beyond his own
tribe, and his negative testimony is not valuable. Rev. A.&nbsp;J. Holt,
from large experience, asserts that the Kaiowa and Comanche women do
know and practice sign language, though the Cheyenne either are more
familiar with it than the Kaiowa or have a greater degree of expertness.
The Comanche women, he says, are the peers of any sign-talkers. Colonel
Dodge makes the broad assertion that even among the Plains tribes only
the old, or at least middle-aged, men use signs properly, and that he
has not seen any women or even young men who were at all reliable in
signs. He gives this statement to show the difficulty in acquiring sign
language; but it is questionable if the fact is not simply the result of
the rapid disuse of signs, in many tribes, by which cause women, not so
frequently called upon to employ them, and the younger generation, who
have had no necessity to learn them, do not become expert. Disappearing
Mist, as before mentioned, remembers a time when the Iroquois women and
children used signs more than the men.</p>

<p>It is also asserted, with some evidence, that the signs used by males
and females are different, though mutually understood, and some minor
points for observation may be indicated, such as whether the
commencement of counting upon the fingers is upon those of the right or
the left hand, and whether Indians take pains to look toward the south
when suggesting the course of the sun, which would give the motion from
left to right.</p>


<p class = "space">
A suggestion has been made by a correspondent that some secret signs of
affiliation are known and used by the members of the several
associations, religious and totemic, which have been often noticed among
several Indian tribes. No evidence of this has been received, but the
point is worth attention.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_notable_negative" id = "sign_notable_negative">
POSITIVE SIGNS RENDERED NEGATIVE.</a></h4>

<p>In many cases positive signs to convey some particular idea are not
reported, and in their place a sign with the opposite signification is
given, coupled with the sign of negation. In other words, the only mode
of expressing the intended meaning is supposed to be by negation of the
reverse of what it is desired to describe. In this manner
“fool&mdash;no,”
<span class = "pagenum">392</span>
<a name = "page392" id = "page392"> </a>
would be “wise,” and “good&mdash;no,” would be “bad.” This mode of
expression is very frequent as a matter of option when the positive
signs are in fact also used. The reported absence of positive signs for
the ideas negatived is therefore often made with as little propriety as
if when an ordinary speaker chose to use the negative form “not good,”
it should be inferred that he was ignorant of the word “bad.” It will
seldom prove, on proper investigation, that where sign language has
reached and retained any high degree of development it will show such
poverty as to require the expedient of negation of an affirmative to
express an idea which is intrinsically positive.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_notable_fingers" id = "sign_notable_fingers">
DETAILS OF POSITIONS OF FINGERS.</a></h4>

<p>The signs of the Indians appear to consist of motions more often than
of positions&mdash;a fact enhancing the difficulty both of their
description and illustration&mdash;and the motions when not designedly
abbreviated are generally large, free, and striking, seldom minute. It
seems also to be the general rule among Indians as among deaf-mutes that
the point of the finger is used to trace outlines and the palm of the
hand to describe surfaces. From an examination of the identical signs
made to each other for the same object by Indians of the same tribe and
band, they appear to make many gestures with little regard to the
position of the fingers and to vary in such arrangement from individual
taste. Some of the elaborate descriptions, giving with great detail the
attitude of the fingers of any particular gesturer and the inches traced
by his motions, are of as little necessity as would be, when quoting a
written word, a&nbsp;careful reproduction of the flourishes of tailed
letters and the thickness of down-strokes in individual chirography. The
fingers must be in <i>some</i> position, but that is frequently
accidental, not contributing to the general and essential effect. An
example may be given in the sign for <i>white man</i> which Medicine
Bull, <i>infra</i>, page 491, made by drawing the palmar surface of the
extended index across the forehead, and in <span class =
"smallcaps">Lean Wolf’s Complaint</span>, <i>infra</i>, page 526, the
same motion is made by the back of the thumb pressed upon the middle
joint of the index, fist closed. The execution as well as the conception
in both cases was the indication of the line of the hat on the forehead,
and the position of the fingers in forming the line is altogether
immaterial. There is often also a custom or “fashion” in which not only
different tribes, but different persons in the same tribe, gesture the
same sign with different degrees of beauty, for there is calligraphy in
sign language, though no recognized orthography. It is nevertheless
better to describe and illustrate with unnecessary minuteness than to
fail in reporting a real distinction. There are, also, in fact, many
signs formed by mere positions of the fingers, some of which are
abbreviations, but in others the arrangement of the fingers in itself
forms a picture. An instance of the latter is one of the signs given for
the <i>bear</i>, viz.: Middle and third finger of right hand clasped
down by the thumb, fore and little finger extended crooked downward. See
<span class = "pagenum">393</span>
<a name = "page393" id = "page393"> </a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Extracts from Dictionary</span>, <i>infra</i>.
This reproduction of the animal’s peculiar claws, with the hand and in
any position relative to the body, would suffice without the pantomime
of scratching in the air, which is added only if the sign without it
should not be at once comprehended.</p>

Fig. 233.</p>
</div>

<p>The specified relation of the positions and motions of the hands to
different parts of the body is essential to the formation and
description of many signs. Those for <i>speak</i>, <i>hear</i>, and
<i>see</i>, which must be respectively made relative to the mouth, ear
and eye, are manifest examples; and there are others less obviously
dependent upon parts of the body, such as the heart or head, which would
not be intelligible without apposition. There are also some directly
connected with height from the ground and other points of reference. In,
however, a&nbsp;large proportion of the signs noted the position of the
hands with reference to the body can be varied or disregarded. The hands
making the motions can be held high or low, as the gesturer is standing
or sitting, or the person addressed is distant or near by. These
variations have been partly discussed under the head of abbreviations.
While descriptions made with great particularity are cumbrous, it is
desirable to give the full detail of that gesture which most clearly
carries out the generic conception, with, if possible, also the
description of such deviations and abbreviations as are most confusing.
For instance, it is well to explain that signs for <i>yes</i> and
<i>no</i>, described with precise detail <ins class = "correction" title
= "text unchanged: superfluous word?">as</ins> in <span class =
"smallcaps">Extracts from Dictionary</span>, <i>infra</i>, are also
often made by an Indian when wrapped in his blanket with only a
forefinger protruding, the former by a mere downward and the latter by a
simple outward bend of that finger. An example may be also taken from
the following sign for <i>lie, falsehood</i>, made by an Arikara, Fig.
233. in which the separated index and second fingers are moved sidewise
in a downward line near but below the mouth, which may be compared with
other executions of the motion with the same position of the fingers
directly forward from the mouth, and with that given in <span class =
"smallcaps">Lean Wolf’s Complaint</span>, illustrated on page 528, in
which the motion is made carelessly across the body. The original sign
was undoubtedly made directly from the mouth, the conception being “two
tongues,” two accounts or
<span class = "pagenum">394</span>
<a name = "page394" id = "page394"> </a>
opposed statements, one of which must be false, but the finger-position
coming to be established for two tongues has relation to the original
conception whether or not made near or in reference to the mouth, the
latter being understood.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that sometimes the position of the fingers is
material as forming or suggesting a figure without reference to motion,
while in other cases the relative position of the hands to each other
and to parts of the body are significant without any special arrangement
of the fingers. Again, in others, the lines drawn in the air by the hand
or hands execute the conception without further detail. In each case
only the essential details, when they can be ascertained, should be
minutely described.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_notable_collecting" id = "sign_notable_collecting">
SUGGESTIONS FOR COLLECTING SIGNS.</a></h4>

<p>The object always should be, not to translate from English into
signs, but to ascertain the real signs and their meaning. By far the
most satisfactory mode of obtaining this result is to induce Indians or
other gesturers observed to tell stories, make speeches, or hold talks
in gesture, with one of themselves as interpreter in his own oral
language if the latter is understood by the observer, and, if not, the
words, not the signs, should be translated by an intermediary linguistic
interpreter. It will be easy afterward to dissect and separate the
particular signs used. This mode will determine the genuine shade of
meaning of each sign, and corresponds with the plan now adopted by the
Bureau of Ethnology for the study of the tribal vocal languages, instead
of that arising out of exclusively missionary purposes, which was to
force a translation of the Bible from a tongue not adapted to its terms
and ideas, and then to compile a grammar and dictionary from the
artificial result. A&nbsp;little ingenuity will direct the more
intelligent or complaisant gesturers to the expression of the thoughts,
signs for which are specially sought; and full orderly descriptions of
such tales and talks with or even without analysis and illustration are
more desired than any other form of contribution.</p>

<p>The original authorities, or the best evidence, for Indian
signs&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Indians themselves&mdash;being still
accessible, the collaborators in this work should not be content with
secondary authority. White sign talkers and interpreters may give some
genuine signs, but they are very apt to interpolate their own
improvements. Experience has led to the apparently paradoxical judgment
that the direct contribution of signs purporting to be those of Indians,
made by a habitual practitioner of signs who is not an Indian, is less
valuable than that of a discriminating observer who is not himself an
actor in gesture speech. The former, being to himself the best
authority, unwittingly invents and modifies signs, or describes what he
thinks they ought to be, often with a very different conception from
that of an Indian. Sign language not being fixed and limited, as is the
case with oral languages, expertness in it is
<span class = "pagenum">395</span>
<a name = "page395" id = "page395"> </a>
not necessarily a proof of accuracy in anyone of its forms. The proper
inquiry is not what a sign might, could, would, or should be, or what is
the best sign for a particular meaning, but what is any sign actually
used for such meaning. If any one sign is honestly invented or adopted
by any one man, whether Indian, African, Asiatic, or deaf-mute, it has
its value, but it should be identified to be in accordance with the fact
and should not be subject to the suspicion that it has been assimilated
or garbled in interpretation. Its prevalence and special range present
considerations of different interest and requiring further evidence.</p>

<p>The genuine signs alone should be presented to scholars, to give
their studies proper direction, while the true article can always be
adulterated into a composite jargon by those whose ambition is only to
be sign talkers instead of making an honest contribution to ethnologic
and philologic science. The few direct contributions of interpreters to
the present work are, it is believed, valuable, because they were made
without expression of self-conceit or symptom of possession by a pet
theory.</p>


<h3><a name = "sign_mode" id = "sign_mode">
MODE IN WHICH RESEARCHES HAVE BEEN MADE.</a></h3>

<p>It is proper to give to all readers interested in the subject, but
particularly to those whose collaboration for the more complete work
above mentioned is solicited, an account of the mode in which the
researches have thus far been conducted and in which it is proposed to
continue them. After study of all that could be obtained in printed
form, and a considerable amount of personal correspondence, the results
were embraced in a pamphlet issued by the Bureau of Ethnology in the
early part of 1880, entitled “<i>Introduction to the Study of Sign
Language among the North American Indians as Illustrating the Gesture
Speech of Mankind.</i>” In this, suggestions were made as to points and
manner of observation and report, and forms prepared to secure
uniformity and accuracy were explained, many separate sheets of which
with the pamphlet were distributed, not only to all applicants, but to
all known and accessible persons in this country and abroad who, there
was reason to hope, would take sufficient interest in the undertaking to
contribute their assistance. Those forms, <span class =
"smallcaps">Types of Hand Positions, Outlines of Arm Positions</span>,
and <span class = "smallcaps">Examples</span>, thus distributed, are
reproduced at the end of this paper.</p>

<p>The main object of those forms was to eliminate the source of
confusion produced by attempts of different persons at the difficult
description of positions and motions. The comprehensive plan required
that many persons should be at work in many parts of the world. It will
readily be understood that if a number of persons should undertake to
describe in words the same motions, whether of pantomimists on the stage
or of other gesturers, even if the visual perception of all the
observers
<span class = "pagenum">396</span>
<a name = "page396" id = "page396"> </a>
should be the same in the apprehension of the particular gestures, their
language in description might be so varied as to give very diverse
impressions to a reader who had never seen the gestures described. But
with a set form of expressions for the typical positions, and skeleton
outlines to be filled up and, when necessary, altered in a uniform
style, this source of confusion is greatly reduced. The graphic lines
drawn to represent the positions and motions on the same diagrams will
vary but little in comparison with the similar attempt of explanation in
writing. Both modes of description were, however, requested, each
tending to supplement and correct the other, and provision was also made
for the notation of such striking facial changes or emotional postures
as might individualize or accentuate the gestures. It was also pointed
out that the prepared sheets could be used by cutting and pasting them
in the proper order, for successive signs forming a speech or story, so
as to exhibit the semiotic syntax. Attention was specially directed to
the importance of ascertaining the intrinsic idea or conception of all
signs, which it was urged should be obtained directly from the persons
using them and not by inference.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1880 the prompt and industrious co-operation of many
observers in this country, and of a few from foreign lands, had supplied
a large number of descriptions which were collated and collected into a
quarto volume of 329 pages, called “<i>A&nbsp;Collection of Gesture
Signs and Signals of the North American Indians, with some
comparisons</i>.”</p>

<p>This was printed on sized paper with wide margins to allow of
convenient correction and addition. It was not published, but was
regarded as proof, a&nbsp;copy being sent to each correspondent with a
request for his annotations, not only in revision of his own
contribution, but for its comparison with those made by others. Even
when it was supposed that mistakes had been made in either description
or reported conception, or both, the contribution was printed as
received, in order that a number of skilled and disinterested persons
might examine it and thus ascertain the amount and character of error.
The attention of each contributor was invited to the fact that, in some
instances, a&nbsp;sign as described by one of the other contributors
might be recognized as intended for the same idea or object as that
furnished by himself, and the former might prove to be the better
description. Each was also requested to examine if a peculiar
abbreviation or fanciful flourish might not have induced a difference in
his own description from that of another contributor with no real
distinction either in conception or essential formation. All
collaborators were therefore urged to be candid in admitting, when such
cases occurred, that their own descriptions were mere unessential
variants from others printed, otherwise to adhere to their own and
explain the true distinction. When the descriptions showed substantial
identity, they were united with the reference to all the authorities
giving them.</p>

<p>Many of these copies have been returned with valuable annotations,
<span class = "pagenum">397</span>
<a name = "page397" id = "page397"> </a>
not only of correction but of addition and suggestion, and are now being
collated again into one general revision.</p>

<p>The above statement will, it is hoped, give assurance that the work
of the Bureau of Ethnology has been careful and thorough. No scheme has
been neglected which could be contrived and no labor has been spared to
secure the accuracy and completeness of the publication still in
preparation. It may also be mentioned that although the writer has made
personal observations of signs, no description of any sign has been
printed by him which rests on his authority alone. Personal controversy
and individual bias were thus avoided. For every sign there is a special
reference either to an author or to some one or more of the
collaborators. While the latter have received full credit, full
responsibility was also imposed, and that course will be continued.</p>

<p>No contribution has been printed which asserted that any described
sign is used by “all Indians,” for the reason that such statement is not
admissible evidence unless the authority had personally examined all
Indians. If any credible person had affirmatively stated that a certain
identical, or substantially identical, sign had been found by him,
actually used by Abnaki, Absaroka, Arikara, Assiniboins, etc., going
through the whole list of tribes, or any definite portion of that list,
it would have been so inserted under the several tribal heads. But the
expression “all Indians,” besides being insusceptible of methodical
classification, involves hearsay, which is not the kind of authority
desired in a serious study. Such loose talk long delayed the recognition
of Anthropology as a science. It is true that some general statements of
this character are made by some old authors quoted in the Dictionary,
but their descriptions are reprinted, as being all that can be used of
the past, for whatever weight they may have, and they are kept separate
from the linguistic classification given below.</p>

<p>Regarding the difficulties met with in the task proposed, the same
motto might be adopted as was prefixed to Austin’s <i>Chironomia</i>:
“<i>Non sum nescius, quantum susceperim negotii, qui motus corporis
exprimere verbis, imitari scriptura conatus sim voces.</i>” <i>Rhet. ad
<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">Herenn.</ins></i>,
l.&nbsp;3. If the descriptive recital of the signs collected had been
absolutely restricted to written or printed words the work would have
been still more difficult and the result less intelligible. The
facilities enjoyed of presenting pictorial illustrations have been of
great value and will give still more assistance in the complete work
than in the present paper.</p>

<p>In connection with the subject of illustrations it may be noted that
a writer in the <i>Journal of the Military Service Institution of the
United States</i>, Vol. II, No. 5, the same who had before invented the
mode of describing signs by “means” mentioned on page 330 <i>supra</i>,
gives a curious distinction between deaf-mute and Indian signs regarding
their respective capability of illustration, as follows: “This French
system is taught, I&nbsp;believe, in most of the schools for deaf-mutes
in this country, and in Europe; but so great has been the difficulty of
fixing the hands
<span class = "pagenum">398</span>
<a name = "page398" id = "page398"> </a>
in space, either by written description or illustrated cuts, that no
text books are used. I&nbsp;must therefore conclude that the Indian sign
language is not only the more natural, but the more simple, as the
gestures can be described quite accurately in writing, and I think can
be illustrated.” The readers of this paper will also, probably, “think”
that the signs of Indians can be illustrated, and as the signs of
deaf-mutes are often identical with the Indian, whether expressing the
same or different ideas, and when not precisely identical are always
made on the same principle and with the same members, it is not easy to
imagine any greater difficulty either in their graphic illustration or
in their written description. The assertion is as incorrect as if it
were paraphrased to declare that a portrait of an Indian in a certain
attitude could be taken by a pencil or with the camera while by some
occult influence the same artistic skill would be paralysed in
attempting that of a deaf-mute in the same attitude. In fact, text books
on the “French system” are used and one in the writer’s possession
published in Paris twenty-five years ago, contains over four hundred
illustrated cuts of deaf-mute gesture signs.</p>

<p>The proper arrangement and classification of signs will always be
troublesome and unsatisfactory. There can be no accurate translation
either of sentences or of words from signs into written English. So far
from the signs representing words as logographs, they do not in their
presentation of the ideas of actions, objects, and events, under
physical forms, even suggest words, which must be skillfully fitted to
them by the glossarist and laboriously derived from them by the
philologer. The use of words in formulation, still more in terminology,
is so wide a departure from primitive conditions as to be incompatible
with the only primordial language yet discovered. No vocabulary of signs
will be exhaustive for the simple reason that the signs are exhaustless,
nor will it be exact because there cannot be a correspondence between
signs and words taken individually. Not only do words and signs both
change their meaning from the context, but a single word may express a
complex idea, to be fully rendered only by a group of signs, and,
<i>vice versâ</i>, a single sign may suffice for a number of words. The
elementary principles by which the combinations in sign and in the oral
languages of civilization are effected are also discrepant. The attempt
must therefore be made to collate and compare the signs according to
general ideas, conceptions, and, if possible, the ideas and conceptions
of the gesturers themselves, instead of in order of words as usually
arranged in dictionaries.</p>

<p>The hearty thanks of the writer are rendered to all his
collaborators, a&nbsp;list of whom is given below, and will in future be
presented in a manner more worthy of them. It remains to give an
explanation of the mode in which a large collection of signs has been
made directly by the officers of the Bureau of Ethnology. Fortunately
for this undertaking, the policy of the government brought to Washington
during the year
<span class = "pagenum">399</span>
<a name = "page399" id = "page399"> </a>
1880 delegations, sometimes quite large, of most of the important
tribes. Thus the most intelligent of the race from many distant and far
separated localities were here in considerable numbers for weeks, and
indeed, in some cases, months, and, together with their interpreters and
agents, were, by the considerate order of the honorable Secretary of the
Interior, placed at the disposal of this Bureau for all purposes of
gathering ethnologic information. The facilities thus obtained were much
greater than could have been enjoyed by a large number of observers
traveling for a long time over the continent for the same express
purpose. The observations relating to signs were all made here by the
same persons, according to a uniform method, in which the gestures were
obtained directly from the Indians, and their meaning (often in itself
clear from the context of signs before known) was translated sometimes
through the medium of English or Spanish, or of a native language known
in common by some one or more of the Indians and by some one of the
observers. When an interpreter was employed, he translated the words
used by an Indian in his oral paraphrase of the signs, and was not
relied upon to explain the signs according to his own ideas. Such
translations and a description of minute and rapidly-executed signs,
dictated at the moment of their exhibition, were sometimes taken down by
a phonographer, that there might be no lapse of memory in any
particular, and in many cases the signs were made in successive motions
before the camera, and prints secured as certain evidence of their
accuracy. Not only were more than one hundred Indians thus examined
individually, at leisure, but, on occasions, several parties of
different tribes, who had never before met each other, and could not
communicate by speech, were examined at the same time, both by inquiry
of individuals whose answers were consulted upon by all the Indians
present, and also by inducing several of the Indians to engage in talk
and story-telling in signs between themselves. Thus it was possible to
notice the difference in the signs made for the same objects and the
degree of mutual comprehension notwithstanding such differences. Similar
studies were made by taking Indians to the National Deaf Mute College
and bringing them in contact with the pupils.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of the actual work of the observation and
record of the signs obtained at Washington has been ably performed by
Dr. <span class = "smallcaps">W.&nbsp;J. Hoffman</span>, the assistant
of the present writer. When the latter has made personal observations
the former has always been present, taking the necessary notes and
sketches and superintending the photographing. To him, therefore,
belongs the credit for all those references in the following “<span
class = "smallcaps">List Of Authorities And Collaborators</span>,” in
which it is stated that the signs were obtained at Washington from
Indian delegations. Dr. <span class = "smallcaps">Hoffman</span>
acquired in the West, through his service as acting assistant surgeon,
United States Army, at a large reservation, the indispensable advantage
of becoming acquainted with the Indian character so as to conduct
skillfully such researches as that in
<span class = "pagenum">400</span>
<a name = "page400" id = "page400"> </a>
question, and in addition has the eye and pencil of an artist, so that
he seizes readily, describes with physiological accuracy, and reproduces
in action and in permanent illustration all shades of gesture exhibited.
Nearly all of the pictorial illustrations in this paper are from his
pencil. For the remainder, and for general superintendence of the
artistic department of the work, thanks are due to Mr. <span class =
"smallcaps">W.&nbsp;H. Holmes</span>, whose high reputation needs no
indorsement here.</p>

LIST OF AUTHORITIES AND COLLABORATORS.</a></h3>

<p>1. A list prepared by <span class = "smallcaps">William
Dunbar</span>, dated Natchez, June 30, 1800, collected from tribes then
“west of the Mississippi,” but probably not from those very far west of
that river, published in the <i>Transactions of the American
Philosophical Society</i>, vol. vi, pp. 1-8, as read January 16, 1801,
and communicated by Thomas Jefferson, president of the society.</p>

<p>2. The one published in <i>An Account of an Expedition from
Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains, performed in the years 1819-1820</i>,
<i>Philadelphia</i>, 1823, vol. i, pp. 378-394. This expedition was made
by order of the Hon. J.&nbsp;O. Calhoun, Secretary of War, under the
command of Maj. <span class = "smallcaps">S.&nbsp;H. Long</span>, of the
United States Topographical Engineers, and is commonly called <ins class
= "correction" title = "not an error: ‘James’ is the author‘s surname">James’</ins>
Long’s Expedition. This list appears to have been
collected chiefly by Mr. T.&nbsp;Say, from the Pani, and the Kansas,
Otos, Missouris, Iowas, Omahas, and other southern branches of the great
Dakota family.</p>

<p>3. The one collected by Prince <span class = "smallcaps">Maximilian
<ins class = "correction" title = "printed in plain type">von</ins>
Wied-Neuwied</span> in <i>Reise in das Innere Nord-America in den Jahren
1832 bis 1834</i>. <i>Coblenz</i>, 1839 [&mdash;1841], vol. ii, pp.
645-653. His statement is, “the Arikaras, Mandans, Minnitarris
[Hidatsa], Crows [Absaroka], Cheyennes, Snakes [Shoshoni], and Blackfeet
[Satsika] all understand certain signs, which, on the contrary, as we
are told, are unintelligible to the Dakotas, Assiniboins, Ojibwas, Krihs
[Crees], and other nations. The list gives examples of the sign language
of the former.” From the much greater proportion of time spent and
information obtained by the author among the Mandans and Hidatsa then
and now dwelling near Port Berthold, on the Upper Missouri, it might be
safe to consider that all the signs in his list were in fact procured
from those tribes. But as the author does not say so, he is not made to
say so in this work. If it shall prove that the signs now used by the
Mandans and Hidatsa more closely resemble those on his list than do
those of other tribes, the internal evidence will be verified. This list
is not published in the English edition, <i>London</i>, 1843, but
appears in the German, above cited, and in the French, <i>Paris</i>,
1840. Bibliographic reference is often made to this distinguished
explorer as “Prince Maximilian,” as if there were but one possessor of
that Christian name among princely families. For brevity the reference
in this paper will be <i>Wied</i>.</p>

<p>No translation of this list into English appears to have been printed
in any shape before that recently published by the present writer in the
<i>American Antiquarian</i>, vol. ii, No. 3, while the German and French
editions are costly and difficult of access, so the collection cannot
readily be compared by readers with the signs now made by the same
tribes.
<span class = "pagenum">402</span>
<a name = "page402" id = "page402"> </a>
The translation now presented is based upon the German original, but in
a few cases where the language was so curt as not to give a clear idea,
was collated with the French edition of the succeeding year, which, from
some internal evidence, appears to have been published with the
assistance or supervision of the author. Many of the descriptions are,
however, so brief and indefinite in both their German and French forms
that they necessarily remain so in the present translation. The princely
explorer, with the keen discrimination shown in all his work, doubtless
observed what has escaped many recent reporters of Indian signs, that
the latter depend much more upon motion than mere position, and are
generally large and free, seldom minute. His object was to express the
general effect of the motion rather than to describe it with such
precision as to allow of its accurate reproduction by a reader who had
never seen it. To have presented the signs as now desired for
comparison, toilsome elaboration would have been necessary, and even
that would not in all cases have sufficed without pictorial
illustration.</p>

<p>On account of the manifest importance of determining the prevalence
and persistence of the signs as observed half a century ago, an
exception is made to the general arrangement hereafter mentioned by
introducing after the <i>Wied</i> signs remarks of collaborators who
have made special comparisons, and adding to the latter the respective
names of those collaborators&mdash;as, (<i>Matthews</i>),
(<i>Boteler</i>). It is hoped that the work of those gentlemen will be
imitated, not only regarding the <i>Wied</i> signs, but many others.</p>

<p>4. The signs given to publication by Capt. <span class =
"smallcaps">R. F. Burton</span>, which, it would be inferred, were
collected in 1860-’61, from the tribes met or learned of on the overland
stage route, including Southern Dakotas, Utes, Shoshoni, Arapahos,
Crows, Pani, and Apaches. They are contained in <i>The City of the
Saints</i>, <i>New York</i>, 1862, pp. 123-130.</p>

<p>Information has been recently received to the effect that this
collection was not made by the distinguished English explorer from his
personal observation, but was obtained by him from one man in Salt Lake
City, a&nbsp;Mormon bishop, who, it is feared, gave his own ideas of the
formation and use of signs rather than their faithful description.</p>

<p>5. A list read by Dr. <span class = "smallcaps">D. G.
Macgowan</span>, at a meeting of the American Ethnological Society,
January 23, 1866, and published in the <i>Historical Magazine</i>, vol.
x, 1866, pp. 86, 87, purporting to be the signs of the Caddos, Wichitas,
and Comanches.</p>

<p>6. Annotations by Lieut. <span class = "smallcaps">Heber M.
Creel</span>, Seventh United States Cavalry, received in January, 1881.
This officer is supposed to be specially familiar with the Cheyennes,
among whom he lived for eighteen months; but his recollection is that
most of the signs described by him were also observed among the Arapaho,
Sioux, and several other tribes.</p>

<p>7. A special contribution from Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">F. F.
Gerard</span>, of Fort A.&nbsp;Lincoln, D.&nbsp;T., of signs obtained
chiefly from a deaf-mute Dakota, who has traveled
<span class = "pagenum">403</span>
<a name = "page403" id = "page403"> </a>
among most of the Indian tribes living between the Missouri River and
the Rocky Mountains. Mr. Gerard’s own observations are based upon the
experience of thirty-two years’ residence in that country, during which
long period he has had almost daily intercourse with Indians. He states
that the signs contributed by him are used by the Blackfeet, (Satsika),
Absaroka, Dakota, Hidatsa, Mandan, and Arikara Indians, who may in
general be considered to be the group of tribes referred to by the
Prince of Wied.</p>

<p>In the above noted collections the generality of the statements as to
locality of the observation and use of the signs rendered it impossible
to arrange them in the manner considered to be the best to study the
diversities and agreements of signs. For that purpose it is more
convenient that the names of the tribe or tribes among which the
described signs have been observed should catch the eye in immediate
connection with them than that those of the observers only should
follow. Some of the latter indeed have given both similar and different
signs for more than one tribe, so that the use of the contributor’s name
alone would create confusion. To print in every case the name of the
contributor, together with the name of the tribe, would seriously burden
the paper and be unnecessary to the student, the reference being readily
made to each authority through this <span class =
"smallroman">LIST</span> which also serves as an index. The seven
collections above mentioned will therefore be referred to by the names
of the authorities responsible for them. Those which now follow are
arranged alphabetically by tribes, under headings of Linguistic Families
according to Major <span class = "smallcaps">J.&nbsp;W. Powell’s</span>

EXTRACTS FROM DICTIONARY.</a></h3>

<p>In the printed but unpublished <i>Collection</i> before mentioned,
page 396, nearly three hundred quarto pages are devoted to descriptions
of signs arranged in alphabetic order. A&nbsp;few of these are now
presented to show the method adopted. They have been selected either as
having connection with the foregoing discussion of the subject or
because for some of them pictorial illustrations had already been
prepared. There is propriety in giving all the signs under some of the
title words when descriptions of only one or two of those signs have
been used in the foregoing remarks. This prevents an erroneous inference
that the signs so mentioned are the only or the common or the generally
prevailing signs for the idea conveyed. This course has involved some
slight repetition both of descriptions and of illustrations, as it
seemed desirable that they should appear to the eye in the several
connections indicated. The extracts are rendered less interesting and
instructive by the necessity for omitting cross-references which would
show contrasts and similarities for comparison, but would require a much
larger part of the collected material to be now printed than is
consistent with the present plan. Instead of occupying in this manner
the remaining space allotted to this paper, it was decided to present,
as of more general interest, the descriptions of <span class =
"smallcaps">Tribal Signs, Proper Names, Phrases, Dialogues, Narratives,
Discourses</span>, and <span class = "smallcaps">Signals</span>, which
follow the <span class = "smallcaps">Extracts</span>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the following extracts there has been an
attempt to supply the conceptions or origin of the several signs. When
the supposed conception, obtained through collaborators, is printed
before the authority given as reference, it is understood to have been
gathered from an Indian as being his own conception, and is therefore of
special value. When printed after the authority and within quotation
marks it is in the words of the collaborator as offered by himself. When
printed after the authority and without quotation marks it is suggested
by this writer.</p>

<p>The letters of the alphabet within parentheses, used in some of the
descriptions, refer to the corresponding figures in <span class =
"smallcaps">Types of Hand Positions</span> at the end of this paper.
When such letters are followed by Arabic numerals it is meant that there
is some deviation, which is described in the text, from that type of
hand position corresponding with the letter which is still used as the
basis of description. Example: In the first description from
(<i>Sahaptin</i>&nbsp;I) for <i>bad, mean</i>, page 412, (G)&nbsp;refers
to the type of hand position so marked, being identically that position,
but in the following reference, to (R&nbsp;1), the type referred to by
the letter
<span class = "pagenum">410</span>
<a name = "page410" id = "page410"> </a>
R has the palm to the front instead of backward, being in all other
respects the position which it is desired to illustrate; (R), therefore,
taken in connection with the description, indicates that change, and
that alone. This mode of reference is farther explained in the <span
class = "smallcaps">Examples</span> at the end of this paper.</p>

<p>References to another title word as explaining a part of a
description or to supply any other portions of a compound sign will
always be understood as being made to the description by the same
authority of the sign under the other title-word. Example: In the second
description by (<i>Sahaptin</i>&nbsp;I) for <i>bad, mean</i>, above
mentioned, the reference to <span class = "smallcaps">Good</span> is to
that sign for <i>good</i> which is contributed by Rev. <span class =
"smallcaps">G.&nbsp;L. Deffenbaugh</span>, and is referred to as
(<i>Sahaptin</i>&nbsp;I.).</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Antelope.</h5>

<p>Pass the open right hand outward from the small of the back.
(<i>Wied</i>.) This, as explained by Indians lately examined, indicates
the lighter coloration upon the animal’s flanks. A&nbsp;Ute who could
speak Spanish accompanied it with the word <i>blanco</i>, as if
recognizing that it required explanation.</p>

<p>With the index only extended, hold the hand eighteen or twenty inches
transversely in front of the head, index pointing to the left, then rub
the sides of the body with the flat hands. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;IV;
<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;VI.) “The latter sign refers to the white sides of
the animal; the former could not be explained.”</p>

<p>Extend and separate the forefingers and thumbs, nearly close all the
other fingers, and place the hands with backs outward above and a little
in front of the ears, about four inches from the head, and shake them
back and forth several times. Antelope’s horns. This is an Arapaho sign.
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I, II,&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<p>Close the right hand, leaving the end of the index in the form of a
hook, and the thumb extended as in Fig. 234; then wave the hand quickly
back and forth a short distance, opposite the temple.
(<i>Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Arikara</i>&nbsp;I.) “Represents the pronged
horn of the animal. This is the sign ordinarily used, but it was noticed
that in conversing with one of the Dakotas the sign of the latter
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;VI) was used several times, to be more readily
understood.”</p>

<p>Place both hands, fingers fully extended and spread, close to the
sides of the head. <i>Wied’s</i> sign was readily understood as
signifying the white flanks. (<i>Apache</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Close the hand, and open it whilst passing it downward.
(<i>Wied</i>.) This is the same as my description; but differently
worded, possibly notes a less forcible form. I&nbsp;say, however, that
the arm is “extended.” The precise direction in which the hand is moved
is not, I&nbsp;think, essential. (<i>Matthews</i>.) This sign is
invariably accompanied by a countenance expressive of contempt.
(<i>F.&nbsp;Jacker</i>.)</p>

<p>Scatter the dexter fingers outward, as if spurting away water from
them. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>(1) Right hand partially elevated, fingers closed, thumb clasping the
tips; (2)&nbsp;sudden motion downward and outward accompanied by equally
sudden opening of fingers and snapping of the fingers from the thumb.
(<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Right hand closed back to front is moved forcibly downward and
forward, the fingers being violently opened at instant of stopping the
motion of hand. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<p>Right hand closed (B) carried forward in front of the body toward the
right and downward, during which the hand is opened, fingers downward,
as if dropping out the contents. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.) “Not worth
keeping.”</p>

<p>Half close the fingers of the right hand, hook the thumb over the
fore and middle fingers; move the hand, back upward, a&nbsp;foot or so
toward the object referred to, and suddenly let the fingers fly open.
Scattered around, therefore bad. An Arapaho sign.

<p>Close the fingers of the right hand, resting the tips against the
thumb, then throw the hand downward and outward toward the right to
arm’s length, and spring open the fingers. Fig. 236.
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;VI, VII, VIII; <i>Ponka</i>&nbsp;II;
<i>Pani</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The sign most commonly used for this idea is made by the hand being
closed near the breast, with the back toward the breast, then as the arm
is suddenly extended the hand is opened and the fingers separated from
each other. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Hands open, palms turned in; move one hand toward, and the other
from, the body; then <i>vice versâ</i>. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Throw the clinched right hand forward, downward, and outward, and
when near at arm’s length, suddenly snap the fingers from the thumb as
<span class = "pagenum">412</span>
<a name = "page412" id = "page412"> </a>
if sprinkling water. (<i>Wyandot</i>&nbsp;I.) “To throw away
contemptuously; not worth keeping.”</p>

<p>Raise hand in front of breast, fingers hooked, thumb resting against
second finger, palm downward (G), then with a nervous movement throw the
hand downward to the right and a little behind the body, with an
expression of disgust on the face. During motion of hand the fingers are
suddenly extended as though throwing something out of the hand, and in
final position the fingers and thumb are straight and separated, palm
backward (R&nbsp;1). (<i>Sahaptin</i>&nbsp;I.) “Away with it!”</p>

<p>Another: Same motion of arm and hand as in <i>good</i>. But in the
first position fingers are closed, and as the hand moves to the right
they are thrown open, until in final position all are extended as in
final for <i>good</i>. (<i>Sahaptin</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Extend the right hand, palm downward, and move it in a horizontal
line from the body, then suddenly turn the hand over as if throwing
water from the back of it or the index. (<i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;I.) “Good,
no.”</p>

<p>Pass the flat right hand, interruptedly, downward and backward past
the right side. (<i>Pima and Papago</i>&nbsp;I.) “Putting aside.”</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs:</i></p>

<p>Hold forward the closed hand with the little finger up, at the same
time nodding the head. (<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p>Draw the tongue out a little and then shake the head with a
displeased look. (<i>Larson</i>.)</p>

<p>Use the sign for <i>handsome</i> (see first part of the sign for
<span class = "smallcaps">Good</span>), at the same time shake the head
as if to say “no.” (<i>Ziegler</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute signs:</i></p>

<p>The hand closed (except the little finger which is extended and
raised), and held forward with the fingers to the front is the sign for
<i>bad</i> illustrated in the Report for 1879 of the Ohio Institution
for the Deaf and Dumb. This sign is used among the deaf-mutes in
England.</p>


<h5><span class = "smallcaps">Bear</span>, animal.</h5>

<p>Pass the hand before the face to mean ugliness, at the same time
grinning and extending the fingers like claws. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Hands in front of and about eight inches above the elbows, fingers
slightly bent and open, thumbs and palms to the front to represent
claws,&mdash;or bear in standing position. Sometimes accompanied by

<p>Fingers of both hands closed, except the thumb and little finger,
which are extended, and point straight toward the front, hands

with short, sharp jerking motions. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.) “From the
motion of the bear in running.” This is also reported as an Arapaho
sign. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.) The paws and claws are represented.</p>

<p>Seize a short piece of wood, say about two feet long, wave in the
right hand, and strike a blow at an imaginary person.
(<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Seize a short thing about six inches long, hold it as
dagger, pretend to thrust it downward under the breast-bone repeatedly,
and each time farther, grunting or gasping in doing so; withdraw the
stick, holding it up, and, showing the blood, point to the breast with
the left forefinger, meaning to say <i>so do thou when you meet the
bear</i>. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Pretend to stab yourself with an arrow in various parts of
the body, then point towards the body with the left-hand forefinger.
(<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Arms are flexed and hands clasped about center of breast; then slowly
fall with arms pendulous and both hands in type-position (Q). The sign
is completed by slowly lifting the hands and arms several times in

indicated a “strong heart,” which is the equivalent for <i>brave</i>.
(<i>Matthews</i>.) This sign is used by the Sioux at the present day to
denote <i>small</i>. (<i>McChesney</i>.) I have seen a similar sign

placed back of the left, then thrown over the latter toward the front
and downward, as in Fig. 241 above. The same gesture has also been made
by throwing the palmar side of the right fist edgewise downward in front
of the knuckles of the left, as in Fig. 243. In each instance the left
fist is jerked upward very perceptibly as the right one is thrust

<p>The forefinger of the right hand extended, pass it perpendicularly
downward, then turn it upward, and raise it in a right line as high as
the head. (<i>Long</i>.) “Rising above others.”</p>

<p>Raise the index finger of the right hand, holding it straight upward,
then turn it in a circle and bring it straight down, a&nbsp;little
toward the earth. (<i>Wied</i>.) The right hand is raised, and in
position (J) describes a semicircle as in beginning the act of throwing.
The arm is elevated perfectly erect aside of the head, the palm of the
index and hand should be outward. There is an evident similarity in both
execution and conception of this sign and <i>Wied’s</i>; the little
variation may be the result of different interpretation. The idea of
superiority is most prominent in both. (<i>Boteler</i>.) “A prominent
one before whom all succumb.” The Arikaras understood this sign, and
they afterwards used it in talking to me. (<i>Creel</i>.) <i>Wied’s</i>
air-picture reminds of the royal scepter with its sphere.</p>

<p>Raise the forefinger, pointed upwards, in a vertical direction, and

<p>The extended forefinger of the right hand (J), of which the other
fingers are closed, is raised to the right side of the head and above it
as far as the arm can be extended, and then the hand is brought down in
front of the body with the wrist bent, the back of hand in front and the
extended forefinger pointing downward. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.) “Raised

others. He looks over or after us. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<p>Elevate the extended index before the shoulder, palm forward, pass it
upward as high as the head, and forming a short curve to the front, then
downward again slightly to the front to before the breast and about
fifteen inches from it. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;VI, VII, VIII;

<p>Right hand closed, forefinger pointing up, raise the hand from the
waist in front of the body till it passes above the head.

against the right forefinger; next send up the right hand above the
head, leaving the left as it is. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The right arm is extended by side of head, with the hand in position
(J). The arm and hand then descend, the finger describing a semicircle
with the arm as a radius. The sign stops with arm hanging at full
length. (<i>Oto</i>&nbsp;I.) “The arm of authority before whom all must
fall.”</p>

<p>Both hands elevated to a position in front of and as high as the
shoulders, palms facing, fingers and thumbs spread and slightly curved;

upward.’”</p>

<p>The flat right hand is waved outward and downward toward the same
side, the head being inclined in the same direction at the time, with
eyes closed. (<i>Wyandot</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Hold the left hand loosely extended about fifteen inches in front of
the breast, palm down, then pass the index, pointing to the left, in a
short curve downward, forward, and upward beneath the left palm.

<p>Bring the left hand to the left breast, hand half clinched (H), then
bring the right hand to the left with the thumb and forefinger in such a
position as if you were going to take a bit of string from the fingers
of the left hand, and pull the right hand off in a horizontal line as if
you were stretching a string out, extend the hand to the full length of
the arm from you and let the index finger point outward at the
conclusion of the sign. (<i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;I.) “Soul going to happy
hunting-grounds.”</p>

<p>The left hand is held slightly arched, palm down, nearly at arm’s

<p><i>Deaf-mute signs:</i></p>

<p>The French deaf-mute conception is that of gently falling or sinking,
the right index falling from the height of the right shoulder upon the
left forefinger, toward which the head is inclined.</p>

<p>The deaf-mute sign commonly used in the United States is the same as
<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;VI; <i>Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Arikara</i>&nbsp;I;
above. Italians with obvious conception, make the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>Hold the left hand as in <i>dead</i>; pass the index with a slow,

<p>The hand held horizontally, back upward, describes with the arm a
horizontal curve outward. (<i>Long</i>.) This is like the Eurasian
motion of benediction, but may more suggestively be compared with
several of the signs for <i>yes</i>, and in opposition to several of
those for <i>bad</i> and <i>no</i>, showing the idea of acceptance or
selection of objects presented, instead of their rejection.</p>

<p>Place the right hand horizontally in front of the breast and move it
forward. (<i>Wied</i>.) This description is essentially the same as the
one I furnished. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.) I&nbsp;stated,
however, that the hand was moved outward (<i>i.e.</i>, to the right).
I&nbsp;do not remember seeing it moved directly forward. In making the
motion as I have described it the hand would have to go both outward and
forward. (<i>Matthews</i>.) The left arm is elevated and the hand held
in position (W). The arm and hand are thus extended from the body on a
level with the chest; the elbow being slightly bent, the arm resembles a
bent bow. The right arm is bent and the right hand, in position (W),
sweeps smoothly over the left arm from the biceps muscle over the ends
of the fingers. This sign and <i>Wied’s</i> are noticeably similar. The
difference is, the <i>Oto</i> sign
<span class = "pagenum">425</span>
<a name = "page425" id = "page425"> </a>
uses the left arm in conjunction and both <i>more to the left</i>. The
conception is of something that easily passes; smoothness, evenness,
etc., in both. (<i>Boteler</i>.)</p>

<p>Wave the hand from the mouth, extending the thumb from the index and
closing the other three fingers. This sign also means <i>I know</i>.
(<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>(1) Right-hand fingers pointing to the left placed on a level with
mouth, thumb inward; (2)&nbsp;suddenly moved with curve outward so as to
present palm to person addressed. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Pass the open right hand, palm downward, from the heart, twenty-four
inches horizontally forward and to the right through an arc of about
90°. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.) “Heart easy or smooth.”</p>

<p>Another: Gently strike the chest two or three times over the heart
with the radial side of the right hand, the fingers partly flexed and
pointing downward. An Arapaho sign. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<p>Place the flat right hand, palm down, thumb touching the breast, then
move it forward and slightly upward and to the right.
(<i>Arapaho</i>&nbsp;II; <i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;V; <i>Ojibwa</i>&nbsp;V;
<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;VI, VII, VIII; <i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i>
III; <i>Apache</i>&nbsp;II; <i>Wichita</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Pass the flat hand, palm down, from the breast forward and in a
slight curve to the right. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;VI;
<i>Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Ankara</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The extended right hand, palm downward, thumb backward, fingers
pointing to the left, is held nearly or quite in contact with the body
about on a level with the stomach; it is then carried outward to the
right a foot or two with a rapid sweep, in which the forearm is moved
but not necessarily the humerus. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Move right hand, palm down, over the blanket, right and left, several
times. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hit the blanket, first on the right, then on the left, palm
down, several times. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Point at the object with the right forefinger, shaking it a
little up and down, the other fingers being closed.
(<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Same as preceding, but with the hand open, the thumb crooked
under and touching the forefinger; hand held at an angle of 45° while
shaking a little back and forth. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hold the closed hands together, thumbs up; separate by
turning the wrists down, and move the fists a little apart; then reverse
movements till back to first position. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hold the left hand with back toward the ground, fingers and
thumb apart, and curved; hold the right hand opposite it, palm
<span class = "pagenum">426</span>
<a name = "page426" id = "page426"> </a>
down, hands about six inches apart; shake the hands held thus, up and
down, keeping them the same distance apart. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hold the hands with the palms in, thumbs up, move hands
right and left, keeping them about six inches apart.
(<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Look at the right hand, first on the back, then on the palm,
then on the back again. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The flat right hand, palm down, is moved forward and upward, starting
at a point about twelve inches before the breast.
(<i>Wyandot</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Hold the flat right hand forward and slightly outward from the
shoulder, palm either upward or downward, and pass it edgewise
horizontally to the right and left. This sign was made when no
personality was involved. The same gesturer when claiming for himself
the character of goodness made the following: Rapidly pat the breast
with the flat right hand. (<i>Pima and Papago</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Throw right hand from front to side, fingers extended and palm down,
forearm horizontal. (<i>Sahaptin</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Make an inclination of the body forward, moving at the same time both
hands forward from the breast, open, with the palm upward, and gradually
lowering them. This is also used for <i>glad, pleased</i>.
(<i>Iroquois</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Bring both hands to the front, arms extended, palms outward; elevate
them upward and slightly forward; the face meanwhile expressive of
wonder. (<i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Bring the hand opposite the breast, a little below, hand extended,
palm downward (W), and let it move off in a horizontal direction. If it
be very good, this may be repeated. If comparatively good, repeat it
more violently. (<i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Hold the right hand palm down, pointing to the left, and placed
horizontally before the breast, then raise it several times slightly.
Good and glad. (<i>Kutchin</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs:</i></p>

<p>Smack the lips. (<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p>Close the hand while the thumb is up, and nod the head and smile as
if to approve of something good. (<i>Hasenstab</i>.)</p>

<p>Point the forefinger to the mouth and move the lips with a pleased
look as if tasting sweet fruit. (<i>Larson</i>.)</p>

<p>Use the sign for <i>handsome</i> by drawing the outstretched palm of
the right hand down over the right cheek; at the same time nod the head
as if to say “yes.” (<i>Ziegler</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute signs:</i></p>

<p>Some of the Indian signs appear to be connected with a pleasant taste
in the month, as is the sign of the French and American deaf-mutes,
waving thence the hand, either with or without touching the lips, back
upward, with fingers straight and joined, in a forward and downward
curve. They make nearly the same gesture with hand sidewise for general
assent: “Very well!”</p>

<p>The conventional sign for <i>good</i>, given in the illustration to
the report of the Ohio Institution for the education of the deaf and
dumb, is: The right hand raised forward and closed, except the thumb,
which is extended upward, held vertically, its nail being toward the
body; this is in opposition to the sign for <i>bad</i> in the same
illustration, the one being merely the exhibition of the thumb toward
and the other of the little finger away from the body. They are English
signs, the traditional conception being acceptance and rejection
respectively.</p>

<p><i>Italian signs:</i></p>

<p>The fingers gathered on the mouth, kissed and stretched out and
spread, intimate a dainty morsel. The open hand stretched out
horizontally, and gently shaken, intimates that a thing is so-so, not
good and not bad. (<i>Butler</i>.) Compare also the Neapolitan sign
given by De Jorio, see <a href = "#fig62">Fig. 62</a>, p.&nbsp;286,
<i>supra</i>. Cardinal Wiseman gives as the Italian sign for <i>good</i>
“the hand thrown upwards and the head back with a prolonged ah!” <i>Loc.
cit.</i>, p.&nbsp;543.</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; Heart is.</h5>

<p>Strike with right hand on the heart and make the sign for <span class
= "smallcaps">Good</span> from the heart outward.
(<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Touch the left breast over the heart two or three times with the ends
of the fingers of the right hand; then make the sign for <span class =
"smallcaps">Good</span>. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<p>Place the fingers of the flat right hand over the breast, then make
the sign for <span class = "smallcaps">Good</span>. (<i>Dakota</i>
VII.)</p>

<p>Move hand to position in front of breast, fingers extended, palm
downward (W), then with quick movement throw hand forward and to the
side to a point 12 or 15 inches from body, hand same as in first
position. (<i>Sahaptin</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

with this sign compare the pictograph, <a href = "#fig204">Fig. 204</a>,
page 379, <i>supra</i>. In ordinary conversation the sign for <i>white
man’s house</i> is often dropped, using instead the generic term
employed for <i>lodge</i>, and this in turn is often abbreviated, as by
the Kaiowas, Comanches, Wichitas, and others, by merely placing the tips
of the extended forefingers together, leaving the other fingers and
thumbs closed, with the wrists about three or four inches apart.</p>

<p>Place the tips of the spread fingers of both hands against one
another pointing upward before the body, leaving a space of from four to
six inches between the wrists. Fig. 257. The fingers are sometimes bent
so as to more nearly represent the outline of a house and roof. Fig.
258. This, however, is accidental. (<i>Pai-Ute</i>&nbsp;I.) “Represents

<p>Place both flat and extended hands in front of the shoulders,
pointing forward, palms facing; then pass them straight upward and
slightly inward near the termination of the gesture. This appears to
combine the gestures for <i>much</i>, <i>large</i>, and <i>lodge</i>.

and pass the right, back upward, with index extended, or all of the
fingers extended, and pointing forward, about eighteen inches forward
underneath the left through an arc from near the mouth. Some at the same
time move the left hand toward the breast. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash;, Entering a.</h5>

<p>The left hand is held with the back upward, and the right hand also
with the back up is passed in a curvilinear direction down under the
other, so as to rub against its palm, then up on the other side of it.
The left hand here represents the low door of the skin lodge and the
right the man stooping down to pass in. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Pass the flat right hand in short curves under the left, which is
held a short distance forward. (<i>Wied</i>.) I have described the same
sign. It is not necessary to pass the hand more than once. By saying
curves, he seems to imply many passes. If the hand is passed more than
once it means repetition of the act. (<i>Matthews</i>;
<i>McChesney</i>.) The conception is of the stooping to pass through the
low entrance, which is often covered by a flap of skin, sometimes
stretched on a frame, and which must be shoved aside, and the subsequent
rising when the entrance has been accomplished. A&nbsp;distinction is
reported by a correspondent as follows: “If the intention is to speak of
a person entering the gesturer’s own lodge, the right hand is passed
under the left and toward the body, near which the left hand is held; if
of a person entering the lodge of another, the left hand is held further
from the body and the right is passed under it and outward. In both
cases both hands are slightly curved and compressed.” As no such
distinction is reported by others it may be an individual invention or
peculiarity.</p>

<p>A gliding movement of the extended hand, fingers joined, backs up,

represented by the left hand. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>First make the sign for <span class = "smallcaps">Lodge</span>, then
place the left hand, horizontal and slightly arched, before the body,
and pass the right hand with extended index underneath the
left&mdash;forward and slightly upward beyond it.

<p>Left hand (W), ends of fingers toward the right, stationary in front
of the left breast; pass the right hand directly and quickly out from
the breast under the stationary left hand, ending with the extended
fingers of the right hand pointing outward and slightly downward,
joined, palm downward flat, horizontal (W). (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.)

<p>Hold the open left hand a foot or eighteen inches in front of the
breast, palm downward or backward, fingers pointing toward the right,
and pass the right hand, palm upward, fingers bent sidewise and pointing
backward, from before backward underneath it, through a curve until near
the mouth. Some at the same time move the left hand a little forward.
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<p>The left hand, palm downward, finger-tips forward, either quite
extended or with the fingers slightly bent, is held before the body.
Then the right hand nearly or quite extended, palm downward, finger-tips
near the left thumb, and pointing toward it, is passed transversely
under the left hand and one to four inches below it. The fingers of the
right hand point slightly upward when the motion is completed. This sign
usually, but not invariably, refers to entering a house. (<i>Mandan and
Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Place the slightly curved left hand, palm down, before the breast,
pointing to the right, then pass the flat right hand, palm down, in a
short curve forward, under and upward beyond the left.
(<i>Ute</i>&nbsp;I.) “Evidently from the manner in which a person is
obliged to stoop in entering an ordinary Indian lodge.”</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Horse.</h5>

<p>The right hand with the edge downward, the fingers joined, the thumb
recumbent, extended forward. (<i>Dunbar</i>.)</p>

<p>Place the index and middle finger of the right hand astraddle the
index finger of the left. [In the original the expression “third” finger
is used, but it is ascertained in another connection that the author
counts the thumb as the first finger and always means what is generally
styled middle finger when he says third. The alteration is made to
prevent confusion.] (<i>Wied</i>.) I have described this sign in words
to the same effect. (<i>Matthews</i>.) The right arm is raised, and the
hand, opened edgewise, with fingers parallel and approximated, is drawn
from left to right before the body at the supposed height of the animal.
There is no conceivable identity in the execution of this sign and
<i>Wied’s</i>, but his sign for <i>horse</i> is nearly identical with
the sign for <i>ride a horse</i> among the Otos. (<i>Boteler</i>.) This
sign is still used by the Cheyennes. (<i>Dodge</i>.)</p>

<p>A hand passed across the forehead. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Left-hand thumb and forefinger straightened out, held to the level of
and in front of the breast; right-hand forefinger separated from the
middle finger and thrown across the left hand to imitate the act of
bestriding. They appear to have no other conception of a horse, and have
thus indicated that they have known it only as an animal to be ridden.

<span class = "pagenum">434</span>

<p>Draw the right hand from left to right across the body about the
heart, the fingers all closed except the index. This is abbreviated by
making a circular sweep of the right open hand from about the left elbow
to the front of the body, probably indicating the mane. A&nbsp;Pani
sign. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;IV.)</p>

<p>Place the first two fingers of the right hand, thumb extended
(N&nbsp;1), downward, astraddle the first two joined and straight
fingers of the left hand (T&nbsp;1), sidewise to the right. Many Sioux
Indians use only the forefinger straightened. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.)
“Horse mounted.”</p>

<p>The first and second fingers extended and separated, remaining
fingers and thumb closed; left forefinger extended, horizontal,
remaining fingers and thumb closed; place the right-hand fingers astride
of the forefinger of the left, and both hands jerked together, up and
down, to represent the motion of a horse. (<i>Dakota</i> III.)</p>

<p>The two hands being clinched and near together, palms downward,
thumbs against the forefingers, throw them, each alternately, forward
and backward about a foot, through an ellipsis two or three times, from
about six inches in front of the chest, to imitate the galloping of a
horse, or the hands may be held forward and not moved.

<p>Place the extended and separated index and second fingers of the
right hand astraddle of the extended forefinger of the left. Fig. 260.
Sometimes all the fingers of the left hand are extended in making this
sign, as in Fig. 261, though this may be the result of carelessness.
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;VI, VII, VIII; <i>Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I;
<i>Ponka</i>&nbsp;II; <i>Arikara</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Pani</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The left hand is before the chest, back upward in the position of an
index-hand pointing forward; then the first and second fingers of the
right hand only being extended, separated and pointing downward, are set
one on each side of the left forefinger, the interdigital space resting
on the forefinger. The palm faces downward and backward. This represents
a rider astride of a horse. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Close hands, except forefingers, which are curved downward; move them
forward in rotation, imitating the fore feet of the horse, and make
puffing sound of “Uh, uh”! (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.) “This sign represents
the horse racing off to a safe distance, and puffing as he tosses his
head.”</p>

<p>The arm is flexed and the hand extended is brought on a level with
the mouth. The hand then assumes the position (W&nbsp;1), modified by
being held edges up and down, palm toward the chest, instead of
<span class = "pagenum">435</span>
<a name = "page435" id = "page435"> </a>
flat. The arm and hand being held thus about the usual height of a horse
are made to pass in an undulating manner across the face or body about
one foot distant from contact. The latter movements are to resemble the
animal’s gait. (<i>Oto</i>&nbsp;I.) “Height of animal and movement of
same.”</p>

<p>The index and second fingers of the right hand are placed astraddle
the extended forefinger of the left. (<i>Wyandot</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hold the right hand flat, extended, with fingers joined, the
thumb extended upward, then pass the hand at arm’s length before the
face from left to right. This is said by the authorities cited below to
be also the Caddo sign, and that the other tribes mentioned originally
obtained it from that tribe. (<i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I;
<i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;I, III; <i>Apache</i>&nbsp;II;

<p>Another: Place the extended and separated index and second fingers
astraddle the extended and horizontal forefinger of the left hand. This
sign is only used when communicating with uninstructed white men, or
with other Indians whose sign for horse is specifically distinct.
(<i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i>&nbsp;II;

<p>Place the extended index and second fingers of the right hand across

<p>Place the right hand, palm down, before the right side of the chest;
place the tips of the second and third fingers against the ball of the
thumb, allowing the index and little fingers to project to represent the
ears. Fig. 265. Frequently the middle fingers extend equally with and
against the thumb, forming the head of the animal, the ears always being
represented by the two outer fingers, viz, the index and little finger.

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Kill, Killing.</h5>

<p>The hands are held with the edge upward, and the right hand strikes

more particularly applicable to convey the idea of death produced by a
blow of the tomahawk or war-club. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Clinch the hand and strike from above downward. (<i>Wied</i>.) I do
not remember this. I&nbsp;have given you the sign for killing with a
stroke. (<i>Matthews</i>.) There is an evident similarity in conception
and execution between the (<i>Oto and Missouri</i>&nbsp;I) sign and
<i>Wied’s</i>. (<i>Boteler</i>.) I have frequently seen this sign made
by the Arikara, Gros Ventre, and Mandan Indians at Fort Berthold Agency.
(<i>McChesney</i>.) This motion, which maybe more clearly expressed as
the downward thrust of a knife held in the clinched hand, is still used
by many tribes for the general idea of “kill,” and illustrates the
antiquity of the knife as a weapon. <i>Wied</i> does not say whether the
clinched hand is thrust downward with
<span class = "pagenum">438</span>
<a name = "page438" id = "page438"> </a>
the edge or the knuckles forward. The latter is now the almost universal
usage among the same tribes from which he is supposed to have taken his
list of signs, and indicates the thrust of a knife more decisively than
if the fist were moved with the edge in advance. The actual employment
of arrow, gun, or club in taking life, is, however, often specified by
appropriate gesture.</p>

<p>Smite the sinister palm earthward with the dexter fist sharply, in

<p>Right hand clinched, thumb lying along the finger tips, elevated to

the left, immediately afterward throwing the right outward and downward
toward the right. (<i>Ute</i>&nbsp;I.) “Killed and falling over.”</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; You; I will kill you.</h5>

<p>Direct the right hand toward the offender and spring the finger from
the thumb, as in the act of sprinkling water. (<i>Long</i>.) The
conception is perhaps “causing blood to flow,” or, perhaps, “sputtering
away the life,” though there is a strong similarity to the motion used
for the <i>discharge of a gun or arrow</i>.</p>

<p>A deprecatory wave of the right hand from front to right, fingers
extended and joined. (<i>Arapaho</i>&nbsp;I;

<p>Right-hand fingers extended together, side of hand in front of and
facing the face, in front of the mouth and waved suddenly to the right.
(<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Place the right hand extended before the body, fingers pointing
upward, palm to the front, then throw the hand outward to the right, and
slightly downward. (<i>Absaroka</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I;

<p>The right hand, horizontal, palm toward the left, is pushed sidewise
outward and toward the right from in front of the left breast.
<i>No</i>, <i>none</i>, <i>I have none</i>, etc., are all expressed by
this sign. Often these Indians for <i>no</i> will simply shake the head
to the right and left. This sign, although it may have originally been
introduced from the white
<span class = "pagenum">441</span>
<a name = "page441" id = "page441"> </a>
people’s habit of shaking the head to express “no,” has been in use
among them for as long as the oldest people can remember, yet they do
not use the variant to express “yes.” (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.)
“Dismissing the idea, etc.”</p>

<p>Place the opened relaxed right hand, pointing toward the left, back
forward, in front of the nose or as low as the breast, and throw it
forward and outward about eighteen inches. Some at the same time turn
the palm upward. Or make the sign at the height of the breast with both
hands. Represents the shaking of the head. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.) The
shaking of the head in negation is not so universal or “natural” as is
popularly supposed, for the ancient Greeks, followed by the modern Turks
and rustic Italians, threw the head back, instead of shaking it, for
“no.” Rabelais makes Pantagruel (Book&nbsp;3) show by many quotations
from the ancients how the shaking of the head was a frequent if not
universal concomitant of oracular utterance&mdash;not connected with
negation.</p>

<p>Another: Pass the ulnar side of the right index along the left index
several times from tip to base, while pronating and supinating the

<p>Both hands closed, brought up in a curved motion toward each other to
the level of the neck or chin. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Both hands and arms are partly extended; each hand is then made to

senses. (<i>Ojibwa</i>&nbsp;V; <i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The French deaf-mutes place the two hands, with fingers united and
extended in a slight curve, nearly together, left above right, in front
of the body, and then raise the left in a direct line above the right,
thus suggesting the idea of a large and slightly-rounded object being
held between the two palms.</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; And heavy.</h5>

<p>Hands open, palms turned in, held about three feet apart, and about

<p>The palm of the hand upward and carried circularly outward, and

<p>The hand held up with the thumb near the face, and the palm directed
toward the person of whom the inquiry is made; then rotated upon the
wrist two or three times edgewise, to denote uncertainty. (<i>Long</i>;
<i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Wichita</i>&nbsp;I.) The motion might be
mistaken for the derisive, vulgar gesture called “taking a sight,”
“<i>donner un pied de nez</i>,” descending
<span class = "pagenum">448</span>
<a name = "page448" id = "page448"> </a>
to our small boys from antiquity. The separate motion of the fingers in
the vulgar gesture as used in our eastern cities is, however, more
nearly correlated with some of the Indian signs for <i>fool</i>, one of
which is the same as that for <i>Kaiowa</i>, see <span class =
"smallcaps">Tribal Signs</span>. It may be noted that the Latin
“<i>sagax</i>,” from which is derived “sagacity,” was chiefly used to
denote the keen scent of dogs, so there is a relation established
between the nasal organ and wisdom or its absence, and that
“<i>suspendere naso</i>” was a classic phrase for hoaxing. The Italian
expressions “<i>restare con un palmo di naso</i>,” “<i>con tanto di
naso</i>,” etc., mentioned by the canon De Jorio, refer to the same
vulgar gesture in which the face is supposed to be thrust forward
sillily. Further remarks connected with this sign appear on pp. 304,
305, <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p>Extend the open hand perpendicularly with the palm outward, and move
it from side to side several times. (<i>Wied</i>.) This sign is still
used. For “outward,” however, I&nbsp;would substitute “forward.” The
hand is usually, but not always, held before the face.
(<i>Matthews</i>.) This is not the sign for <i>question</i>, but is used
to attract attention before commencing a conversation or any other time
during the talk, when found necessary. (<i>McChesney</i>.) With due
deference to Dr. McChesney, this is the sign for <i>question</i>, as
used by many tribes, and especially Dakotas. The Prince of Wied probably
intended to convey the motion of <i>forward, to the front</i>, when he
said <i>outward</i>. In making the sign for <i>attention</i> the hand is
held more nearly horizontal, and is directed toward the individual whose
attention is desired. (<i>Hoffman</i>.)</p>

<p>Right hand in front of right side of body, forearm horizontal, palm
of hand to the left, fingers extended, joined and horizontal, thumb
extending upward naturally, turn hand to the left about 60°, then resume

depending on earnestness of inquiry. (<i>Creel</i>.)</p>

<p>Right hand, fingers pointing upward, palm outward, elevated to the

hand, palm inward, with all the fingers straight joined, as far as may

times, being performed by the muscles of the arm. (<i>Sac, Fox, and

<p>One is a sort of note of interrogation. For instance, if I were to
meet a native and make the sign: Hand flat, fingers and thumb extended,
the two middle fingers touching, the two outer slightly separated from
the middle by turning the hand palm upward as I met him, it would mean:
“Where are you going?” In other words I should say “<i>Minna?</i>” (what
name?). (<i>Smyth</i>.) Fig. 275.</p>

<p>The upright nearly closed hands, thumbs against the middle of the

<p>Sign for <span class = "smallcaps">White Man</span> as follows: The
extended index (M&nbsp;turned inward) is drawn from the left side of the
head around in front to the right side, about on a line with the brim of
the hat, with the back of the hand outward; and then for <span class =

both hands with fingers turned inward, straight, backs joined, backs of
hands outward, horizontal, turn outward the hands until the fingers are
free, curve them, and bring the wrists together so as to describe a
circle with a space left between the ends of the curved fingers.
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.) “From his fortified place of abode.”</p>

<p>Another: Both hands in front of body, fists, backs outward, hands in

<p>Strike the extended index finger of the right hand several times upon
that of the left. (<i>Wied</i>.) I have described the same sign in
different terms and at greater length. It is only necessary, however, to
place the fingers in contact once. The person whom the prince saw making
this sign may have meant to indicate something more than the simple idea
of trade, <i>i.e.</i>, trade often or habitually. The idea of frequency
is often conveyed by the repetition of a sign (as&nbsp;in some Indian
languages by repetition of the root). Or the sign-maker may have
repeated the sign to demonstrate it more clearly. (<i>Matthews</i>.)
Though some difference exists in the motions executed in <i>Wied’s</i>
sign and that of (<i>Oto and Missouri</i>&nbsp;I), there is sufficient
similarity to justify a probable identity of conception and to make them
easily understood. (<i>Boteler</i>.) In the author’s mind
<i>exchange</i> was probably intended for one transaction, in which each
of two articles took the place before occupied by the other, and
<i>trade</i> was intended for a more general and systematic barter,
indicated by the repetition of strokes. Such distinction would not
perhaps have occurred to most observers, but as the older authorities,
such as Long and Wied, give distinct signs under the separate titles of
<i>trade</i> and <i>exchange</i> they must be credited with having some
reason for so doing. A&nbsp;pictograph connected with this sign is shown
on page 381, <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p>Cross the forefingers of both hands before the breast.
(<i>Burton</i>.) “Diamond cut diamond.” This conception of one smart
trader cutting into the profits of another is a mistake arising from the
rough resemblance of the sign to that for <i>cutting</i>. Captain Burton
is right, however, in reporting that this sign for <i>trade</i> is also
used for <i>white man, American</i>, and that the same Indians using it
orally call white men “shwop,” from the English or American word “swap”
or “swop.” This is a legacy from the early traders, the first white men
met by the Western tribes, and the expression extends even to the
Sahaptins on the Yakama River, where it appears incorporated in their
language as <i>swiapoin</i>. It must have penetrated to them through the
Shoshoni.</p>

<p>Cross the index fingers. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Cross the forefingers at right angles. (<i>Arapaho</i> I.)</p>

<p>Both hands, palms facing each other, forefingers extended, crossed
right above left before the breast. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>The left hand, with forefinger extended, pointing toward the right
(rest of fingers closed), horizontal, back outward, otherwise as (M), is
held in front of left breast about a foot; and the right hand, with
forefinger extended (J), in front of and near the right breast, is
carried outward and struck over the top of the stationary left (+)
crosswise, where it remains for a moment. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The forefingers are extended, held obliquely upward, and crossed at

<p>Bring each hand as high as the breast, forefinger pointing up, the

(<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Ponka</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The palm point of the right index extended touches the chest; it is
then turned toward the second individual interested, then touches the
object. The arms are now drawn toward the body, semiflexed, with the
hands, in type-positions (W&nbsp;W), crossed, the right superposed to
the left. The individual then casts an interrogating glance at the
second person. (<i>Oto and Missouri</i>&nbsp;I.) “To cross something
from one to another.”</p>

<p>Close the hands, except the index fingers and the thumbs; with them
open, move the hands several times past one another at the height of the

(<i>Iroquois</i>&nbsp;I.) “The movement indicates ‘exchanging.’”</p>

<p>Hold the left hand horizontally before the body, with the forefinger
only extended and pointing to the right, palm downward; then, with the
right hand closed, index only extended, palm to the right, place the
index at right angles on the forefinger of the left, touching at the
second joints. (<i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i>&nbsp;II; <i>Wichita</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Close the fingers of both hands (K); bring them opposite each

pointing at the left shoulder. (<i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Close both hands, leaving the forefingers only extended; place the
right before and several inches above the left, then pass the right hand
toward the left elbow and the left hand toward the right elbow, each

This sign, according to the informant, is also employed by the Banak and
Umatilla Indians. (<i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;II; <i>Pai-Ute</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The forefingers of both hands only extended, pass the left from left

<p>Left hand, with forefinger extended, others closed (M, except back of

closed, is placed crosswise over the left and maintained in that
position for a moment, when the fingers of the right hand are relaxed
(as&nbsp;in&nbsp;Y), brought near the breast with hand horizontal, palm
inward, and then carried out again in front of right breast twenty
inches, with palm looking toward the left, fingers pointing forward,
hand horizontal, and then the left hand performs the same movements on
the left side of the body<ins class = "correction" title =

“You give me, I&nbsp;give you.”</p>

<p>The hands, backs forward, are held as index hands, pointing upward,

other, moved to the opposite shoulder, so that the forearms cross one
another almost at right angles. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>


<h5><span class = "smallcaps">Yes; Affirmation; It is so</span>.
(Compare <span class = "smallcaps">Good</span>.)</h5>

<p>The motion is somewhat like <i>truth</i>, viz: The forefinger in the
attitude of pointing, from the mouth forward in a line curving a little
upward, the other fingers being carefully closed; but the finger is held
rather more upright, and is passed nearly straightforward from opposite
the breast,
<span class = "pagenum">455</span>
<a name = "page455" id = "page455"> </a>
and when at the end of its course it seems gently to strike something,
though with rather a slow and not suddenly accelerated motion.
(<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Wave the hand straight forward from the face. (<i>Burton</i>.) This
may be compared with the forward nod common over most of the world for
assent, but that gesture is not universal, as the New Zealanders elevate
the head and chin, and the Turks are reported by several travelers to
shake the head somewhat like our negative. Rev. H.&nbsp;N. Barnum denies
that report, giving below the gesture observed by him. He, however,
describes the Turkish gesture sign for <i>truth</i> to be “gently bowing
with head inclined to the right.” This sidewise inclination may be what
has been called the shake of the head in affirmation.</p>

<p>Another: Wave the hand from the mouth, extending the thumb from the
index and closing the other three fingers. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Gesticulate vertically downward and in front of the body with the
extended forefinger (right hand usually), the remaining fingers and
thumb closed, their nails down. (<i>Creel</i>;
<i>Arapaho</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Right hand elevated to the level and in front of the shoulder, two
first fingers somewhat extended, thumb resting against the middle
finger; sudden motion in a curve forward and downward.
(<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.) It has been suggested that the correspondence
between this gesture and the one given by the same gesturer for
<i>sitting</i> (made by holding the right hand to one side, fingers and
thumb drooping, and striking downward to the ground or object to be sat
upon) seemingly indicates that the origin of the former is in connection
with the idea of “resting,” or “settling a question.” It is however at
least equally probable that the forward and downward curve is an
abbreviation of the sign for <i>truth, true</i>, a typical description
of which follows given by (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I). The sign for
<i>true</i> can often be interchanged with that for <i>yes</i>, in the
same manner as the several words.</p>

<p>The index of the horizontal hand (M), other fingers closed, is
carried straight outward from the mouth. This is also the sign for
<i>truth</i>. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.) “But one tongue.”</p>

<p>Extend the right index, the thumb against it, nearly close the other
fingers, and holding it about a foot in front of the right breast, bend
the hand from the wrist downward until the end of the index has passed
about six inches through an arc. Some at the same time move the hand
forward a little. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.) “A&nbsp;nod; the hand
representing the head and the index the nose.”</p>

<p>The right hand, with the forefinger only extended and pointing
forward, is held before and near the chest. It is then moved forward one
or two feet, usually with a slight curve downward. (<i>Mandan and
Hidatsa</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Bend the right arm, pointing toward the chest with the index finger;
unbend, throwing the hand up and forward. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Close the three fingers, close the thumb over them, extend
forefinger, and then shake forward and down. This is more emphatic than
the preceding, and signifies, <i>Yes, I&nbsp;know</i>.
(<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>The right arm is raised to head with the index finger in
type-position (I&nbsp;1), modified by being more opened. From aside the
head the hands sweep in a curve to the right ear as of something
entering or hearing something; the finger is then more open and carried
direct to the ground as something emphatic or direct. (<i>Oto and
Missouri</i>&nbsp;I.) “‘I&nbsp;hear,’ emphatically symbolized.” It is
doubted if this sign is more than an expression of understanding which
may or may not imply positive assent. It would not probably be used as a
direct affirmative, for instance, in response to a question.</p>

<p>The hand open, palm downward, at the level of the breast, is moved
forward with a quick downward motion from the wrist, imitating a bow of
the head. (<i>Iroquois</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Throw the closed right hand, with the index extended and bent, as
high as the face, and let it drop again naturally; but as the hand
reaches its greatest elevation the index is fully extended and suddenly
drawn into the palm, the gesture resembling a beckoning from above
toward the ground. (<i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i>&nbsp;II; <i>Wichita</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Quick motion of the right hand forward from the mouth; first position
about six inches from the mouth and final as far again away. In first
position the index finger is extended, the others closed; in final, the
index loosely closed, thrown in that position as the hand is moved
forward, as though hooking something with it; palm of hand out.
(<i>Sahaptin</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Another: Move right hand to a position in front of the body, letting
arm hang loosely at the side, the thumb standing alone, all fingers
hooked except forefinger, which is partially extended (E&nbsp;1, palm

The sign consists in moving the forefinger from its partially extended

of the thumb against the ends of the fore and middle fingers, and then
place the back of the hand against the forehead. This sign is also made
by the Arapahos. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.) “To imitate the flying of a

<p>With the right hand closed, curve the thumb and index, join their

<p>Both hands, fists, (B, except thumbs) in front of body, backs looking
toward the sides of the body, thumbs obliquely upward, left hand
stationary, the backs of the fingers of the two hands touching, carry
the right thumb forward and backward at the inner side of the left thumb
and without moving the hand from the left, in imitation of the act of
shelling corn. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I, VII, VIII.)</p>

<p>Collect the fingers and thumb of the right hand nearly to a point,
and make a tattooing or dotting motion toward the upper portion of the
cheek. This is the old sign, and was used by them previous to the
adoption of the more modern one representing “corn-eaters.”
(<i>Arikara</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Place the back of the closed right hand transversely before the
mouth, and rotate it forward and backward several times. This gesture
may be accompanied, as it sometimes is, by a motion of the jaws as if
eating, to illustrate more fully the meaning of the rotation of the
fist. (<i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Wichita</i>&nbsp;II; <i>Apache</i>&nbsp;I.) “Corn-eater; eating corn
from the ear.”</p>

<p>Signified by the same motions with the thumbs and forefingers that
are used in shelling corn. The dwarf Ree (Arikara) corn is their
peculiar possession, which their tradition says was given to them by a
superior being, who led them to the Missouri River and instructed them
how to plant it. (Rev. C.&nbsp;L. Hall, in <i>The Missionary Herald</i>,

sign is also used to indicate the Gros Ventres of the Prairie or Atsina.
(<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Make the sign of <i>cutting the throat</i>. (<i>Kutine</i> I.) As the
Assinaboins belong to the Dakotan stock, the sign generally given for
the Sioux may be used for them also.</p>

<p>With the right hand flattened, form a curve by passing it from the
top of the chest to the pubis, the fingers pointing to the left, and the

just back of the left, and move as if picking small objects from the
left with the tip of the right thumb. (<i>Absaroka</i>&nbsp;I;
<i>Shoshoni and Banak</i>&nbsp;I.) “Corn-shellers.”</p>

<p>Bring the extended and separated fingers and thumb loosely to a
point, flexed at the metacarpal joints; point them toward the left
clavicle, and imitate a dotting motion as if tattooing the skin.
(<i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i>&nbsp;II;

from the left to the right and out to nearly at arm’s length. They used
to cut the throats of their prisoners. (<i>Pai-Ute</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>Major Haworth states that the <i>Banaks</i> make the following sign
for themselves: Brush the flat right hand backward over the forehead as
if forcing back the hair. This represents the manner of wearing the tuft
of hair backward from the forehead. According to this informant, the
Shoshoni use the same sign for <span class = "smallcaps">Banak</span> as
for themselves.</p>

hand is drawn toward the body until the index is drawn clear off; then
repeat. Some Cheyennes believe this to have reference to the former
custom of cutting the arm as offerings to spirits, while others think it
refers to a more ancient custom of cutting off the enemy’s fingers for
necklaces. (<i>Cheyenne</i>&nbsp;II.)</p>

<p>Place the extended index at the right side of the nose, where it
joins the face, the tip reaching as high as the forehead, and close to
the inner corner of the eye. This position makes the thumb of the right
hand rest upon the chin, while the index is perpendicular. (<i>Sac, Fox,
and Kickapoo</i>&nbsp;I.) It is considered that this sign, though given
to the collaborator as expressed, was an error. It applies to the
Southern Arapahos. Lieutenant Creel states the last remark to be
correct, the gesture having reference to the Southern bands.</p>

<p>As though sawing through the left forearm at its middle with the edge
of the right held back outward, thumb upward. Sign made at the left side

<p>Right-hand fingers and thumb extended and joined (as in S), outer

<p>Draw the extended right index or the ulnar (inner) edge of the open
right hand several times across the base of the extended left index, or
across the left forearm at different heights from left to right. This
sign is also made by the Arapahos. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;IV.) “Because
their arms are marked with scars from cuts which they make as offerings
to spirits.”</p>

<p>Draw the extended index several times across the extended forefinger
from the tip toward the palm, the latter pointing forward and slightly
toward the right. From the custom of striping arms transversely with
colors. (<i>Kaiowa</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Comanche</i>&nbsp;II, III;

follows: Collect the thumb, index, and second fingers to a point, hold
them above and in front of the mouth and make a repeated dotting motion

more commonly called “Snake”, Indians, who as well as the Comanches
belong to the Shoshonian linguistic family. “The silent stealth of the
tribe.” (<i>Dodge</i>; <i>Marcy</i> in <i>Thirty Years of Army Life on
the Border</i>. <i>New York</i>, 1866, p.&nbsp;33.) Rev. A.&nbsp;J. Holt
remarks, however, that among the Comanches themselves the conception of
this sign is the trailing of a rope, or lariat. This refers probably to
their well-known horsemanship.</p>

<p>Motion of a snake. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Hold the elbow of the right arm near the right side, but not touching
it; extend the forearm and hand, palm inward, fingers joined on a level
with the elbow, then with a shoulder movement draw the forearm and hand
back until the points of the fingers are behind the body; at the same
time that the hand is thus being moved back, turn it right and left
several times. (<i>Creel</i>; <i>Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo</i>&nbsp;I.)
“Snake in the grass. A&nbsp;snake drawing itself back in the grass
instead of crossing the road in front of you.”</p>

<p>Another: The sign by and for the Comanches themselves is made by
holding both hands and arms upward from the elbow, both palms inward,
and passing both hands with their backs upward along the lower end of
the hair to indicate <i>long hair</i>, as they never cut it. (<i>Sac,

<p>Indicate a circle over the upper portion of the right cheek, with the
index or several fingers of the right hand. The statement of the Indian
authorities for the above is that years ago the Wichita women painted
spiral lines on the breasts, starting at the nipple and extending
several inches from it; but after an increase in modesty or a change in
the upper garment, by which the breast ceased to be exposed, the cheek
has been adopted as the locality for the sign. (<i>Creel</i>;

<p>Extend the fingers and thumb of the right hand, semi-closed, and

<i>e.g.</i>, both arms are flexed at a right angle before the chest; the
hands then assume type position (L) modified by the index being hooked
and the middle finger partly opened and hooked similarly; the hands are
held horizontally and rotated forward side by side to imitate two
wheels, palms upward; and the sign for <i>council</i> as follows: The
right arm is raised, flexed at elbow, and the hand brought to the mouth
(in&nbsp;type position G 1, modified by being inverted), palm up, and
the index being more open. The hand then passes from the mouth in jerks,
opening and closing successively; then the right hand (in&nbsp;position
S&nbsp;1), horizontal, marks off divisions on the left arm extended. The
sign for <i>father</i> is briefly executed by passing the open hand down
and from the loins, then bringing it erect before the body; then the
sign for <i>cars</i>, making with the mouth the noise of an engine. The
hands then raised before the eyes and approximated at points, as in the

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; What do you want?</h5>

<p>The arm is drawn to front of chest and the hand in position

the chest center the hand is then passed spirally forward toward the one
addressed; the hand’s palm begins the spiral motion with a downward and
ends in an upward aspect. (<i>Oto</i>&nbsp;I.) “To unwind or open.”</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; Whence come you?</h5>

<p>First the sign for <i>you</i>, viz: The hand open, held upward

to the breast, and lastly the sign for <i>bringing</i>, as follows: The
hand half shut, with the thumb pressing against the forefinger, being
first moderately

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; Who are you? or what is your name?</h5>

<p>The right or left hand approximates close to center of the body; the
arm is flexed and hand in position (D), or a little more closed. From
inception of sign near center of body the hand slowly describes the arc
of a quadrant, and fingers unfold as the hand recedes. We think the
proper intention is for the inception of sign to be located at the
heart, but it is seldom truly, anatomically thus located.
(<i>Oto</i>&nbsp;I.) “To unfold one’s self or make known.”</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; Are you through?</h5>

<p>It will be noticed that the gesture No. 4, “am going to,” was made
before the gesture No.&nbsp;5, “my home,” although the Dakota words
pronounced were in the reverse order, showing a difference in the syntax
of the gestures and of the oral speech in this instance. The other
gestures, 1, 2, and 3, had been made deliberately, the Dakota word
translating

<p>The orthography in the above sentences, as in others where the
original text is given (excepting the Dakota and Ojibwa), is that
adopted by Maj. <span class = "smallcaps">J.&nbsp;W. Powell</span> in
the second edition of the <i>Introduction to the Study of Indian
Languages</i>. <i>Washington</i>, 1880. The characters more particularly
requiring explanation are the following, viz:</p>

<div class = "list">

<p><i>ñ</i>, as <i>ng</i> in <i>sing</i>, <i>singer</i>; Sp.

<p><i>ʞ</i>, an intermediate sound between <i>k</i> and <i>g</i> in
<i>gig</i>.</p>

<p><i>kh</i>, as the German <i>ch</i>, in <i>nacht</i>.</p>

<p><i>ʇ</i>, an intermediate sound between <i>t</i> and <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>Nasalized vowels are written with a superior <i>n</i>, thus:
<i>aⁿ</i>, <i>eⁿ</i>.</p>

asterisks appear in the above dialogue the preposition <i>to</i> is
included in the gesture. After touching the breast for <i>I</i>, the
slow movement forward signifies <i>going to</i>, and <i>country</i> is
signified by locating it at arm’s length toward the west, to the left of
the gesturer, as the stopping-place, also <i>possession</i> by the
clinched fist being directed toward the ground. It is the same as for
<i>my</i> or <i>mine</i>, though made before the body in the latter
signs. The direction of Tendoy’s hands, first to the south and
afterwards to the north, was understood not as pointing to the exact
locality of the two parts of the country, but to the difference in their
respective climates.</p>

DIALOGUE BETWEEN ALASKAN INDIANS.</a></h4>

<p>The following introductory notes are furnished by Mr. <span class =
"smallcaps">Ivan Petroff</span>, who contributes the Dialogue:</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly stated that among the natives of Alaska no
trace of gesture or sign language can be found. The universal spread
<span class = "pagenum">493</span>
<a name = "page493" id = "page493"> </a>
of the Russian language in former times as a medium of trade and general
intercourse has certainly prevented observations of this primitive
linguistic feature in all the vast regions visited by the Russians. On
the other hand, the homogeneous elements of the Innuit tongue, spoken
along the whole seacoast from the Arctic to the Alaskan Peninsula, and
the Island of Kadiak, has, to a great extent, abolished all causes for
the employment of sign language between tribes in their mutual
intercourse. Basing their opinions upon what they saw while touching
upon the coast here and there, even the acknowledged authorities on
Alaskan matters have declared that sign language did not and could not
exist in all that country. Without entering into any lengthened dispute
upon this question, I&nbsp;venture to present in the subjoined pages a
succinct account of at least one instance where I saw natives of
different tribes converse with each other only by means of signs and
gestures within the boundaries of Alaska.</p>

<p>In the month of September, 1866, there arrived on the Lower Kinnik
River, a&nbsp;stream emptying its waters into Cook’s Inlet, two Indians
from a distant region, who did not speak the Kenaitze language. The
people of the settlement at which the strangers made their first
appearance were equally at a loss to understand the visitors. At last a
chief of great age, bearing the name of Chatidoolts (mentioned by
Vancouver as a youth), was found to be able to interpret some of the
signs made by the strangers, and after a little practice he entered into
a continued conversation with them in rather a roundabout way, being
himself blind. He informed me that it was the second or third time
within his recollection that strangers like those then present had come
to Kinnik from the northeast, but that in his youth he had frequently
“talked with his hands” to their visitors from the west and east. He
also told me that he had acquired this art from his father, who, as the
old man expressed himself, had “seen every country, and spoken to all
the tribes of the earth.” The conversation was carried on with the help
of the old man’s sons, who described to their blind parent the gestures
of the strangers, and were instructed in turn by him with what gestures
to reply.</p>

<p>This being an entirely new experience to me I at once proceeded to
carefully make notes of the desultory talk, extending over several days.
My object, primarily, was to make use of the signs for purposes of trade
in the future.</p>

<p>The notes thus obtained contain a narrative of the two strangers,
interpreted to me at the time by Chatidoolts. I&nbsp;shall present each
sign or sentence as I noted it at the time, with only casual reference
to that incomplete and frequently erroneous interpretation.</p>

<p>The two Indians wore the pointed hunting shirt of tanned moose-skin,
ornamented with beads and fringes which is still common to the Kutchin
tribes. They were not tattooed, but ears and noses were encumbered with
pendants of dentalium and a small red glass bead. Their feet were
<span class = "pagenum">494</span>
<a name = "page494" id = "page494"> </a>
clothed in moccasins. One of them had a rifle of English manufacture,
and his companion carried two huge knives, one of them of copper
evidently of native manufacture.</p>

OJIBWA DIALOGUE.</a></h4>

<h6>[Communicated by the Very Rev. <span class = "smallcaps">Edward
Jacker</span>.]</h6>

<p>The following short dialogue forms part of the scanty tradition the
civilized Ojibwas possess regarding their ancestors’ sign language:</p>

<p>Two Indians of different tongue meet on a journey. First Indian
points to second Indian with the outstretched forefinger of the right
hand, bringing it within a few inches of his breast; next he extends
both forearms horizontally, clinches all but the forefingers, and bends
the hands inward; then he brings them slowly and in a straight line
together, until the tips of the outstretched forefingers meet. This
gesture is accompanied with a look of inquiry&mdash;<i>You met
somebody?</i></p>

<p>Second Indian, facing the south, points to the east, and with the
outstretched hand forms a half-circle from east to west (corresponding
to the daily course of the sun); then he raises the arm and points to a
certain height above the southern horizon. Then the sign for
<i>meeting</i> (as&nbsp;above) may be made, or omitted. After this he
bends the right hand downward, and repeatedly moves the outstretched
forefinger and middle finger in opposite directions (in&nbsp;imitation
of the motion of the legs in the act of walking). Finally he raises the
right hand and stretches up the forefinger (or&nbsp;several fingers).
<i>To-day, when the sun stood at such a height, I&nbsp;met one
(or&nbsp;several) persons traveling on foot.</i> If the travelers met
were on horseback he makes the sign for <i>horse</i> as described by
(<i>Dakota</i> III), see <span class = "smallcaps">Extracts from
Dictionary</span>, or the identical one for <i>going</i> given by
(<i>Ojibwa</i>&nbsp;I), which is as follows: To describe a journey on
horseback the first two fingers of the right hand are placed astride of
the forefinger of the left hand, and both represent the galloping
movement of a horse. If it is a foot journey, wave the two fingers
several times through the air.</p>

<p>The above was paraphrased orally by the narrator as follows: “Hearing
of the trouble in the north, I&nbsp;started eastward from my camp in
Western Nevada, when, upon arriving at Winnemucca Station,
I&nbsp;received telegraphic orders from the head chief to go north to
induce our bands in that region to escape the approaching difficulties
with the Banaks. I&nbsp;started for Camp McDermit, where I remained one
night. Leaving next morning in company with nine others, we rode on for
four days and a half. Soon after our arrival at the Pai-Ute camp, two
Banaks came in, when I sent twelve Pai-Utes to their camp to ask them
all to come in to hold council. These messengers soon returned, when I
collected all the Pai-Utes ands talked to them all night regarding the
dangers of an alliance with the Banaks and of their continuance in that
locality. Next morning I sent my brother to the chief, Winnimukka, with
a report of proceedings.</p>

<p>“On the following day three white men rode into camp, who had come up
to aid in persuading the Pai-Utes to move away from the border. Next
morning I consulted with them respecting future operations, after which
they went away a short distance to their camp. I&nbsp;then followed
them, where I shot and killed a steer, and while skinning it the Banaks
came in, when the meat was distributed. The Banaks being disposed to
become violent at any moment, the white men became alarmed, when
<span class = "pagenum">504</span>
<a name = "page504" id = "page504"> </a>
I told them that rather than allow them to be scalped I would be scalped
myself in defending them, for which action I would be considered as
great a chief as Winnemukka by my people. When I told the Banaks to
cease threatening the white men they all moved to one side a short
distance to hold a war council, and after the sun went down the white
men and I mounted our horses and fled toward the south, whence we
came.”</p>

<p>Some of the above signs seem to require explanation. Natci was facing
the west during the whole of this narration, and by the right he
signified the north; this will explain the significance of his gesture
to the right in Nos. 11 and 17, and to the left in No. 75.</p>

<p>No. 2 (repeated in Nos. 22, 27, 33, and 41) designates an Indian
brush lodge, and although Natci has not occupied one for some years, the
gesture illustrates the original conception in the round form of the
foundation of poles, branches, and brush, the interlacing of which in
the construction of the <i>wik´-i-up</i> has survived in gestures Nos.
3&nbsp;and 23 (the latter referring to more than one, <i>i.e.</i>, an
encampment).</p>

<p>The sign for Banak, No. 25 (also 32 and 59), has its origin from the
tradition among the Pai-Utes that the Banaks were in the habit of
cutting the throats of their victims. This sign is made with the index
instead of the similar gesture with the flat hand, which among several
tribes denotes the Sioux, but the Pai-Utes examined had no specific sign
for that body of Indians, not having been in sufficient contact with
them.</p>

<p>“A stopping place,” referred to in Nos. 6, 12, 52, and 54, represents
the temporary station, or camp of white men, and is contradistinguished
from a village, or perhaps from any permanent encampment of a number of
persons, by merely dotting toward the ground instead of indicating a
circle.</p>

<p>It will also be seen that in several instances, after indicating the
nationality, the fingers previously used in representing the number were
repeated without its previously accompanying specific gesture, as in No.
61, where the three fingers of the left hand represented the men
(white), and the three movements toward the ground signified the camp or
tents of the three (white) men.</p>

<p>This also occurs in the gesture (Nos. 59, 60, and 71) employed for
the Banaks, which, having been once specified, is used subsequently
without its specific preceding sign for the tribe represented.</p>

<p>The rapid connection of the signs Nos. 57 and 58 and of Nos. 74 and
75 indicates the conjunction, so that they are severally readily
understood as “shot <i>and</i> killed,” and “the white men
<i>and</i>&nbsp;I.” The same remark applies to Nos. 15 and 16, “the nine
<i>and</i>&nbsp;I.”</p>

<p>Far westward beyond the Rio Grande are the Warm Spring Apaches, who
killed many Mexicans and soldiers and stole their horses. They (the Warm
Spring Apaches) are bad and fools.</p>

<p>Some cavalry came here under an aged officer of high rank, but of
inferior intelligence, to capture the Mescalero Indians.</p>

<p>The Mescaleros wished to have their village permanently here by the
agency, and to receive their rations, <i>i.e.</i>, were peacefully
inclined.</p>

<p>Our village was over there. I saw the general come with troops and
San Carlos scouts to surround (or&nbsp;capture) the Mescalero Indians.
There were a great many San Carlos scouts and soldiers.</p>

<p>I saw that my people were afraid, and half of them fled.</p>

<p>Next morning the Mescaleros did not shoot (were not hostile). The
<span class = "pagenum">508</span>

others came and killed many Mescaleros. The cavalry and infantry brought
us (the Mescaleros) to this camp as prisoners.</p>

<p>The San Carlos scouts were well supplied with ammunition and guns,
and shot many Warm Spring Indians and Mescaleros.</p>

<p>The following is contributed by Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">Francis
Jacker</span>:</p>

<p class = "space">
This narrative was related to me by <i>John Na-wa-gi-jig</i> (literally
“noon-day sky”), an aged Ojibwa, with whom I have been intimately
connected for a long period of years. He delivered his story, referring
to one of the many incidents in his perilous life, orally, but with
pantomimes so graphic and vivid that it may be presented truly as a
specimen of gesture language. Indeed, to any one familiar with Indian
mimicry, the story might have been intelligible without the expedient of
verbal language, while the oral exposition, incoherent as it was, could
hardly be styled anything better than the subordinate part of the
delivery. I&nbsp;have endeavored to reproduce these gestures in their
original connections from memory, omitting the verbal accompaniment as
far as practicable. In order to facilitate a clear understanding it is
stated that the gesturer was in a sitting posture before a camp fire by
the lake shore, and facing the locality where the event referred to had
actually occurred, viz, a&nbsp;portion of Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior,
in the neighborhood of Portage Entry, as seen by the annexed diagram,
Fig. 319. The time of the relation (latter part of April) also coincided
with the <i>actual</i> time. In speaking of “arm,” “hand,” “finger,”
&amp;c., the “right” is understood if not otherwise specified. “Finger”
stands for “forefinger.”</p>

Fig. 319.&mdash;Scene of Na-wa-gi-jig’s story.</p>

<p>(1) With the exclamation “<i>me-wi-ja</i>” (a long time ago), uttered
in a slow and peculiarly emphatic manner, he elevated the arm above and
toward the right at the head, accompanying the motion with an upward
wave of the hand and held it thus suspended a moment&mdash;<i>a long
time ago</i>. (This gesture resembles sign for <i>time, a&nbsp;long</i>,
of which it seems to be an abbreviation, and it is not sufficiently
clear without the accompanying exclamation.) Withdrawing it slowly, he
placed the hand back upon his knee.</p>

<p>(2) He then brought up the left hand toward the temple and tapped his
hair, which was gray, with the finger&mdash;<i>hair gray</i>.</p>

<p>(3) From thence he carried it down upon the thigh, placing the
extended finger perpendicularly upon a fold of his trousers, which the
thumb and finger of the right held grasped in such a manner as to
advantageously present the smooth black surface of the cloth&mdash;<i>of
that color</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>black</i>.</p>

<p>(4) Next, with a powerful strain of the muscles, he slowly stretched
<span class = "pagenum">509</span>
<a name = "page509" id = "page509"> </a>
out the right arm and fist and grasping the arm about the elbow with the
left, he raised the forearm perpendicularly upward, then brought it down
with force, tightening the grasp in doing so (fingers pressing upon
knuckle, thumb against pit of elbow)&mdash;<i>strength</i>.</p>

<p>(5) Pointing first at me&mdash;<i>you</i>.</p>

<p>(6) He next held out the hand horizontally and flat, palm downward,
about four feet above the ground, correcting the measure a moment
afterward by elevating hand a few inches higher, and estimated the
height thus indicated with a telling look, leaning the head toward the
side&mdash;<i>about that height</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>a youth of about
that size</i>.</p>

<p>(7) He then rapidly extended the arm about two-thirds of its length
forward and toward the right, terminating the motion with a jerk of the
hand upward, palm turned outward, and accompanied the motion with a nod
of the head, the hand in its downfall closing and dropping upon
knee&mdash;<i>very well</i>.</p>

<p>(8) Musing a few moments, he next slowly extended the arm and pointed
with the fingers toward and along the surface of the frozen
bay&mdash;<i>out there</i>.</p>

<p>(9) In an easterly direction&mdash;<i>eastward</i>.</p>

<p>(10) Thence turning the arm to the right he nodded the finger toward
a projection of land southward at a distance of about two
miles&mdash;following in each case the direction of the finger with the
eyes&mdash;and immediately after placed the hand again eastward,
indicating the spot with the same emphatic nod of the finger as though
carrying the visible distance to a spot upon the expanse of the bay,
which, bearing no object, could not be marked otherwise&mdash;<i>two
miles out there</i>.</p>

<p>(11) Carrying the finger toward the body, he touched his
breast&mdash;<i>I myself</i>.</p>

<p>(12) Thence erected the hand, turning its palm forward, forefinger
perpendicularly extended, others slightly closed, and nodded it downward
in an explanatory manner, all in an uninterrupted
movement&mdash;<i>one</i>, meaning in connection with the preceding
gesture&mdash;<i>I for one</i>.</p>

<p>(13) Again, with an emphatic movement, he turned the hand upward,
slightly erecting the index, thumb pointing forward, remaining fingers
partially and naturally opened and more or less
separated&mdash;<i>furthermore</i>.</p>

<p>(14) Then quickly and after a moment’s stop brought down the hand to
a horizontal position, first and second fingers joining and fully
extending during the movement, and pointing
forward&mdash;<i>another</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>joined by another</i>.
Repeating this motion, he at the same time called out the name
<i>Ga-bi-wa-bi-ko-ke</i>.</p>

<p>(15) Following the exclamation with a repetition of No.
2&mdash;<i>gray hair</i>&mdash;repeatedly touching the hair, meaning in
this case&mdash;<i>an old man</i>.</p>

<p>(16) Pointed with the finger toward the right, directing it obliquely
toward the ground&mdash;<i>at a short distance toward my right</i>.</p>

<p>(17) Repeated No. 13&mdash;<i>furthermore</i>.</p>

<p>(18) Repeated No. 14, adding the third finger to joined fore and
middle
<span class = "pagenum">510</span>
<a name = "page510" id = "page510"> </a>
fingers, thumb resting upon tip of fourth&mdash;<i>another</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>joined by a third</i>, and pronounced the words
“<i>o-gwis-san Sa-ba-dis</i>” (this is a corruption of the French “Jean
Baptiste,” a&nbsp;favorite name among Christianized
Indians)&mdash;<i>John Baptist, his son</i>, while repeating the
movement.</p>

<p>(19) Held up the three separated fingers perpendicularly in front of
the face, pushing the hand forward a little&mdash;<i>three in
all</i>.</p>

<p>(20) Presently lowered the hand, fingers relaxing, and carried it a
short distance toward the left, thence back to the right, fingers
pointing obliquely toward the ground in each case&mdash;<i>placed to the
right and left of me at a short distance</i>.</p>

<p>(21) He then brought the hand&mdash;back toward the right, index
horizontally extended, remaining fingers closed, thumb placed against
second finger&mdash;in front of abdomen, and moved it slowly up and down
two or three times, giving it a slight jerk at the upward motion, and
raising the arm partially in doing so. At the same time he inclined the
body forward a little, eyes looking down&mdash;<i>fishing</i>. This
refers to fishing on the ice, and, as may be inferred from it, to the
use of hook and line. A&nbsp;short stick to which the line is attached
serves as a rod and is moved up and down in the manner described.</p>

<p>(22) After a short pause he elevated the hand, directing the index
toward that point of the meridian which the sun passes at about the
tenth hour of the day, and following the direction with the
eye&mdash;<i>about ten o’clock</i>.</p>

<p>(23) Turning his face toward the southwest and holding up the flat
and extended hand some distance in front of it, back outward, he waved
it briskly and several times toward the face&mdash;<i>fresh breeze from
the southwest</i>.</p>

<p>(24) Repeated No. 21 (<i>fishing</i>), playing the imaginary
fish-line up and down regularly for a while, till all at once he changed
the movement by raising the hand in an oblique course, which movement he
repeated several times, each time increasing the divergence and the
length of the motion&mdash;<i>the fish-hook don’t sink perpendicularly
any longer</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>it is moving</i>.</p>

<p>(25) Quickly erecting his body he looked around him with
surprise&mdash;<i>looking with surprise</i>.</p>

<p>(26) Shading his eyes with the hand, gazed intensively toward the
south&mdash;<i>fixedly gazing toward the south</i>.</p>

<p>(27) Threw up his arm almost perpendicularly the next
moment&mdash;<i>greatly astonished</i>.</p>

<p>(28) Extended and slowly moved the arm from southeast to northwest as
far as he could reach, at the same time exclaiming “<i>mig-wam</i>”
“ice”&mdash;<i>the ice from shore to shore</i>.</p>

<p>(29) Approximated the flat and horizontally extended hands, backs
upward, with their inner edges touching, whereupon, suddenly turning the
edges downward, he withdrew them laterally, backs nearly opposed to each
other&mdash;<i>parting</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">511</span>
<a name = "page511" id = "page511"> </a>
<p>(30) Pushed the left hand, palm outward, fingers joined, edges up and
down, forward and toward its side with a full sweep of the arm, head
following the movement&mdash;<i>pushed in that direction</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>northeastward</i>.</p>

<p>(31) Repeated No. 23, but waved the hand only once and with a quick
and more powerful movement toward the face&mdash;<i>by the force of the
wind</i>.</p>

<p>(32) Rotated hands in front of body, rolling them tips over tips very
rapidly, fingers with thumbs nearly collected to a
point&mdash;<i>winding up the hook-line in a hurry</i>.</p>

<p>(33) Quickly passed the hand toward the left breast of his
coat&mdash;<i>putting it in pocket</i>.</p>

<p>(34) And bending the body forward made motion as if picking up
something&mdash;<i>picking up</i>.</p>

<p>(35) Raised the hand closed to fist, arm elevated so as to form a
right angle with elbow, and made a short stroke downward and toward the
left&mdash;<i>hatchet</i>.</p>

<p>(36) Thence moved the hand to side of breast and pushed it down the
waist&mdash;<i>putting it into belt</i>.</p>

<p>(37) Placed the closed hands to each side of the waist (thumbs upward
with tips facing each other) and approximated them rapidly and with a
jerk in front of navel&mdash;<i>tightening the belt</i>.</p>

<p>(38) With both hands lowered to the ground, he described an elongated
oval around his foot by placing tips of forefingers together in front of
the toes and passing them around each side, meeting the fingers behind
the heel and running them jointly backward a few inches to indicate a
tail&mdash;<i>snow-shoe</i>.</p>

<p>(39) Raised up the heel, resting the foot on the toes and turning it
a little toward the right, brought it back in a downward movement with a
jerk&mdash;<i>putting it on</i>.</p>

<p>(40) Waved the left hand emphatically forward, palm backward, fingers
joined and pointing downward, extending them forward at termination of
motion, at the same time pushing forward the
head&mdash;<i>starting</i>.</p>

<p>(41) Directed the finger of the same hand toward the
light-house&mdash;<i>toward that point</i>.</p>

<p>(42) Pointed with extended first two fingers of the same hand, thumb
with remaining fingers partially extended to right and to
left&mdash;<i>companions</i>.</p>

<p>(43) Repeated No. 40 (<i>starting</i>) less emphatically.</p>

<p>(44) Made several very quick jumping movements forward with the
extended left fingers, joined, back upward&mdash;<i>going very
fast</i>.</p>

<p>(45) Repeated No. 23 (<i>wind</i>), increasing the force of the
movement and terminating the sign with the second repetition
(wave)&mdash;<i>wind increasing</i>.</p>

<p>(46) Raised up the hand in front of head and then arrested it a
moment, palm outward, fingers extended, upward and
forward&mdash;<i>halt</i>.</p>

<p>(47) Partially turning the body toward the north he lowered the
extended hand, back forward, fingers joined and pointing downward toward
the left of his feet and moved it closely in front of them, and with
<span class = "pagenum">512</span>
<a name = "page512" id = "page512"> </a>
a cutting motion toward the right, following the movement with the
eye&mdash;<i>cut off right before feet</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>standing on
the very edge</i>.</p>

<p>(48) Still facing the north, he carried the hand, back upward,
fingers joined and extended, from left side of body outward and toward
the right horizontally, indicating the rippled surface of turbulent
water by an appropriate motion, and extending the arm to full length,
fingers pointing northeastward (toward the right) at termination of
motion, and accompanied the movement with a corresponding turn of the
head, eyes gazing far into distance&mdash;<i>water all along the
shore</i>.</p>

<p>(49) Pushed the extended finger, back upward, forward (<i>i.e.</i>,
northward) in a slightly arched movement&mdash;<i>across</i>.</p>

<p>(50) Directing it toward an object (tree) at a distance of about one
hundred yards the next moment&mdash;<i>a distance of about one hundred
yards</i>.</p>

<p>(51) Repeated No. 49 (<i>across</i>) without interrupting the
motion&mdash;<i>that distance placed across</i>.</p>

<p>(52) Motions as follows: Hands naturally relaxed, edges up and down,
backs outward, are with a quick movement and simultaneously carried from
the epigastrium forward and toward their sides, arms being extended from
elbows only. The hands change their position during the movement and are
ultimately placed palms upward, thumbs and fingers extended and widely
separated, pointing forward. This is the general sign for <i>doubt</i>.
He also turned the face from one side to the other as though
interrogating his companions&mdash;<i>what are we to do?</i></p>

<p>(53) Repeated No. 35 (<i>hatchet</i>).</p>

<p>(54) Raised up the finger perpendicularly, other fingers closed,
thumb resting against second, and emphatically inclined it
forward&mdash;<i>only one</i>.</p>

<p>(55) Elevated the arm from the elbow toward the head, hand naturally
relaxed, back obliquely upward, inclining the face sideward with a look
of consternation, simultaneously, and again mechanically lowered it,
dropping palm of hand heavily upon the knee&mdash;“<i>bad fix</i>.”</p>

<p>(56) Placed the hand to his hip and raised it up, closed to fist, by
a rapid and very energetic movement, ejaculating <i>haw!&mdash;quick to
the work</i> (referring to the ax or hatchet).</p>

<p>(57) Turning the body downward, he passed the hand, with forefinger
directed toward the ground, forward, sideward, and backward, in three
movements, each time turning at a right angle&mdash;<i>measuring off a
square piece on the ground</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>on the ice</i>.</p>

<p>(58) Looked and pointed toward an object some twenty feet off, then
opposed palms of hands horizontally, and at a short distance from each
other, connecting both movements in such a manner as to clearly
illustrate their meaning&mdash;<i>about twenty feet wide</i>.</p>

<p>(59) Moved the hand&mdash;fist, thumb upward&mdash;several times
quickly up and down a few inches, the arm progressing forward at every
stroke&mdash;<i>cutting it off</i>.</p>

<p>(60) Repeated No. 55 (<i>bad fix</i>), meaning in this
case&mdash;<i>bad job</i>.</p>

<p>(61) Opposed the palms of both hands, vertically, at a distance of
<span class = "pagenum">513</span>
<a name = "page513" id = "page513"> </a>
eight inches, holding them thus steady a moment and estimating the thus
indicated measure with the eyes&mdash;<i>eight inches thick</i>.</p>

<p>(62) Then struck the palm of left with the back of arched right
forcibly&mdash;<i>solid ice</i>.</p>

<p>(63) Laid the joined and extended first two fingers, palm up, across
side of leg, a&nbsp;foot above heel, accompanying the movement with the
eye&mdash;<i>one foot deep</i>.</p>

<p>(64) Pushed downward perpendicularly and from same point the flat,
extended hand&mdash;<i>sinking</i>, or <i>giving in</i>&mdash;and
turning the hand upward at wrist, back downward, he flirted up the
fingers several times quickly&mdash;<i>water&mdash;slush and
water</i>.</p>

<p>(65) Passed one hand over the other as in the act of pulling off
mittens&mdash;<i>mittens</i>.</p>

<p>(66) Made the motion of wringing out a wet piece of
cloth&mdash;<i>wringing wet</i>.</p>

<p>(67) Grasped a fold of his trowsers (below the knee) and wrung
it&mdash;<i>trowsers also wet</i>.</p>

<p>(68) Placed palms of both hands upon legs, near to the ankles, and
dragged them up to the knees&mdash;<i>up to the knees</i>.</p>

<p>(69) Shivered&mdash;<i>feeling cold</i>.</p>

<p>(70) Pointed with thumb backward and toward the right (designating
his companion) and repeated No. 2&nbsp;(<i>hair gray</i>)&mdash;<i>my
old companion</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Ga-bi-wa-bi-ko-ke</i>.</p>

<p>(71) Repeated No. 69 (<i>feeling cold</i>) more
emphatically&mdash;<i>more so</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>suffering worse from
the cold</i>.</p>

<p>(72) Repeated No. 59 (<i>cutting the ice</i>).</p>

<p>(73) Made sign for <i>tired&mdash;getting tired</i>, as follows: The
left arm is partly extended forward, and is gently struck near the bend
of the elbow, usually above it, with the palm of the right hand, at the
same time the head is usually inclined to the left side, then in similar
manner the right arm is extended and struck by the left hand, and the
head in turn inclined to the right.</p>

<p>(74) Repeated No. 35&mdash;(<i>hatchet</i>).</p>

<p>(75) Turned the slightly closed left (thumb obliquely upward) over to
its side, partially opening it in so doing, fingers pointing to
left&mdash;<i>passing it over to his companion at the left</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Sabadis</i>.</p>

<p>(76) Flung forefingers of both hands, backs forward, thumbs upward,
remaining fingers partially closed, toward their respective sides
alternately&mdash;<i>by turns</i>.</p>

<p>(77) Repeated No. 59 (<i>cutting the ice</i>).</p>

<p>(78) Elevated the hand above head, thumb and first two fingers
extended and directed toward the western meridian, and shook it
emphatically and with a tremulous motion up and down while thus
suspended&mdash;<i>at a late hour</i>.</p>

<p>(79) Followed with the sign for <i>done, finished</i>, as follows:
Left hand, with forearm horizontally extended toward the right, is held
naturally
<span class = "pagenum">514</span>
<a name = "page514" id = "page514"> </a>
relaxed, back outward, a&nbsp;few inches in front of body and at a right
angle with opposite hand, which is placed on a higher level, slightly
arched, edge downward, fingers joined and extended forward. Pass the
right quickly and with a cutting motion downward and toward its side, at
the same time withdraw the left a few inches toward the opposite
direction&mdash;<i>finished our work</i>.</p>

<p>(80) Quickly threw up his arm, ejaculating “haw!”&mdash;<i>let us
start</i>.</p>

<p>(81) Passed both hands approximated in front of body, naturally
relaxed, backs outward, forward and toward their respective sides,
extending and widely separating the fingers during the movement, and
again approximating them with quickly accelerated speed and arresting
them, closed to fists, in front of body and with a jerk
upward&mdash;<i>with united efforts</i>.</p>

<p>(82) Placing the fists, thumbs upward, pointing forward and placed
upon side of forefingers, with their wrists against the breast, he
pushed them forward and downward a few inches, head slightly
participating in the movement&mdash;<i>pushing off</i>.</p>

<p>(83) Repeated No. 38 (<i>snow-shoe</i>)&mdash;<i>with
snow-shoes</i>.</p>

<p>(84) Immediately reassumed the position of “pushing off” as in No.
82, slowly passing forward the fists further and
further&mdash;<i>pushing and gradually moving off</i>.</p>

<p>(85) Quickly passed and turned the closed left forward, upward, and
backward, opening and again closing the fingers in so doing, and
executing at almost the same instant a similar, but smaller, revolution
with the right&mdash;<i>turning over the snow-shoe, tail up</i>.</p>

<p>(86) With both hands closed to fists, left obliquely over the right
and on the right side of the body, made motion as if
paddling&mdash;<i>paddling</i>.</p>

<p>(87) Moved and pointed finger of left towards its side, <i>i.e.</i>,
northward&mdash;<i>toward the shore</i>.</p>

<p>(88) Moved both hands, flat and extended, backs upward, toward the
left side, by an even and very slow movement&mdash;<i>moving along very
slowly toward that direction</i>.</p>

<p>(89) Repeated No. 23&mdash;<i>southwest wind</i>.</p>

<p>(90) Repeated No. 30&mdash;<i>pushing northeastward</i>.</p>

<p>(91) Turned the thumb of left over to the
left&mdash;<i>Sabadis.</i></p>

<p>(92) Repeated No. 32 (<i>winding up</i>), reversing the
motion&mdash;<i>winding off the hook-line</i>.</p>

<p>(93) Approximated both hands with their tips horizontally in front of
body, first two fingers with thumb collected to a point, and moving the
fingers as in the act of twisting a cord, gradually receded the
hands&mdash;<i>twisting</i>.</p>

<p>(94) Thrust forward three fingers of the right&mdash;<i>three</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>hook-lines</i>.</p>

<p>(95) Repeated No. 93, then rubbed palm of flat and extended right
forward over the thigh repeatedly and with a slight
pressure&mdash;<i>twisting them tightly</i>.</p>

<p>(96) Approximated both hands closed to fists, thumbs upward, in
<span class = "pagenum">515</span>
<a name = "page515" id = "page515"> </a>
front of body and pulled them asunder repeatedly by short, quick, and
sudden jerks&mdash;<i>proving strength of line</i>.</p>

<p>(97) Hooked the forefinger, hand turned downward at wrist, remaining
fingers closed, thumb resting upon first&mdash;<i>fish-hook</i>.</p>

<p>(98) Raised and curved three fingers and thrust them forward a little
separated, back to the front&mdash;<i>three</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>hooks</i>.</p>

<p>(99) Collecting fore and middle fingers of each hand to a point with
thumb, he opposed tips of both hands, vertically describing with the
upper hand several short circular movements around the tip of the
lower&mdash;<i>tying together</i>.</p>

<p>(100) Hooked the separated fore and middle fingers of the right,
pointing upward, back forward, and placed the hooked finger of the left,
palm forward, in front and partially between the fork of the
first&mdash;<i>in the shape of an anchor</i>.</p>

<p>(101) Thrust both hands, backs upward, fingers extended and
separated, forward (<i>i.e.</i>, northward), vigorously, left being
foremost&mdash;<i>throwing toward the shore</i>.</p>

<p>(102) Thence elevating the right toward the head, he thrust it
downward in an oblique direction, fore and middle fingers extended and
joined with the thumb&mdash;<i>sinking</i>.</p>

<p>(103) Placing hands in the position attained last in No. 100
(<i>throwing out toward shore</i>), he closed the fingers, drawing the
hands back toward the body and leaning backward
simultaneously&mdash;<i>hauling in</i>.</p>

<p>(104) Elevated the naturally closed hand to side of head, fingers
opening and separating during the movement&mdash;at the same time and
with a slight jerk of the shoulders inclining the head
sideward&mdash;and again closed and slowly dropped it upon
knee&mdash;<i>in vain</i>.</p>

<p>(105) Dropped the finger perpendicularly downward, following the
movement with the eye&mdash;<i>bottom</i>.</p>

<p>(106) Passed the flat hand, palm down, from side to side in a smooth
and horizontal movement&mdash;<i>smooth</i>.</p>

<p>(107) Made the sign for <i>stone, rock</i>, as follows: With the back
of the arched right hand (H) strike repeatedly in the palm of the left,
held horizontal, back outward, at the height of the breast and about a
foot in front, the ends of the fingers pointing in opposite
directions.</p>

<p>(108) Repeated No. 100&mdash;<i>anchor</i>.</p>

<p>(109) Dragged the curved fore and middle fingers over the back of the
extended left&mdash;<i>dragging</i>.</p>

<p>(110) Waved the left&mdash;bent at the wrist, back
outward&mdash;forward and upward from body, extending the arm to full
length, at the same time inclining and pushing forward the head, and
repeated the gesture more emphatically&mdash;<i>trying again and
again</i>.</p>

<p>(111) Waved both hands&mdash;backs outward, fingers slightly joined,
tips facing each other and closely approximated in front of
breast&mdash;forward and toward their respective sides a short distance,
turning the palms upward during the movement, thumb and fingers being
extended and
<span class = "pagenum">516</span>
<a name = "page516" id = "page516"> </a>
widely separated toward the last. At the same time he inclined the head
to one side, face expressing disappointment&mdash;<i>all in
vain</i>.</p>

<p>(112) Repeated No. 80&mdash;<i>Let us start anew!</i></p>

<p>(113) Repeated No. 86&mdash;<i>paddling</i>.</p>

<p>(114) Repeated the preceding gesture, executing the movement only
once very emphatically&mdash;<i>vigorously</i>.</p>

<p>(115) Waved the finger toward the place of the setting sun, following
the direction with the eye&mdash;<i>day is near its close</i>.</p>

<p>(116) Repeated No. 69, more emphatically&mdash;<i>feeling very
cold</i>.</p>

<p>(117) Repeated No. 70&mdash;<i>Ga-bi-wa<ins class = "correction"
title = "hyphen missing or invisible">-</ins>bi-ko-ke</i>.</p>

<p>(118) Made sign for <i>without</i>, dropping the hands powerless at
the sides, with a corresponding movement of
head&mdash;<i>exhausted</i>.</p>

<p>(119) Pointed with finger toward the light-house and drawing back the
finger a little, pushed it forward in the same direction, fully
extending the arm&mdash;<i>that distance</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>one mile
beyond light-house</i>.</p>

word <i>ke-ya-bi</i>&mdash;<i>only yet</i>.</p>

<p>(132) Pointed the finger toward the upturned root of a tree a few

with a glance sideways at the height thus indicated&mdash;<i>the sun
just setting</i>.</p>

<p>(134) Made three vigorous strokes with the imaginary
paddle&mdash;<i>three more paddle-strokes</i>.</p>

<p>(135) Moved both hands (flat and extended, backs upward) evenly and
horizontally toward the left, terminating the movement by turning hands
almost perpendicularly upward at wrist, thus arresting them
suddenly&mdash;<i>the ice-raft runs up against the shore</i>.</p>

<p>(136) Lastly threw up the hand perpendicularly above head, and
bringing it down, placed the palm gently over the heart with an air of
solemnity&mdash;<i>we are saved</i>.</p>

<p>Many years ago&mdash;my hair, then black and smooth, has since turned
gray; I&nbsp;was then in the prime of life; you, I&nbsp;suppose, were a
young lad at that time&mdash;the following incident occurred to me:</p>

<p class = "space">
Yonder on the ice, two miles eastward, I was one day fishing in company
with two others, the old Gabiwabikoke and his son John Baptist. It was
about ten o’clock in the morning&mdash;a fresh breeze from the southwest
had previously been getting up&mdash;when the hook-line which I was
playing up and down began to take an oblique course as though it were
moved by a current. Surprised, I&nbsp;looked up and around me. When
glancing toward the south I saw a dark streak stretching from shore to
shore across the bay; the ice had parted and the wind was carrying it
out toward the open lake. In an instant I had wound up my hook-line,
picked up my hatchet and snow-shoes, which I put on my feet, and
hurried&mdash;the others following my example&mdash;toward the nearest
point of land, yonder where the light-house stands. The wind was
increasing and we traveled as fast as we could. There we arrived at the
very edge of the ice, a&nbsp;streak of water about one hundred yards in
width extending northward along the shore as far as we could see. What
to begin with, nothing but a single hatchet? We were in a bad situation.
Well, something had to be done. I&nbsp;measured off a square piece on
the ice and began cutting it off with the hatchet, a&nbsp;hard and
tedious labor. The ice was only eight inches thick, but slush and water
covered it to the depth of a foot. I&nbsp;soon had my mittens and
trowsers wringing wet and began to feel cold and tired. The old
Gabiwabikoke was in a worse state than&nbsp;I. His son next took the
hatchet and we all worked by turns. It was about two o’clock in the
afternoon when we finished our work. With the help of our snow-shoes
(stemming their tail-ends against the edge of the solid ice), we
succeeded in pushing off our raft. Turning our snow-shoes the other way
(using their tails as handles), we commenced paddling with them toward
the shore. It was a very slow progress, as the wind drifted us outward
continually. John Baptist managed to twist
<span class = "pagenum">518</span>
<a name = "page518" id = "page518"> </a>
our three hook-lines into a strong cord, and tying the hooks together in
the shape of an anchor, he threw it out toward the shore. Hauling in the
line the hooks dragged over the smooth rock bottom and would not catch.
Repeated trials were of no avail. We all resumed our former attempt and
paddled away with increased energy. The day was drawing near its close,
and we began to feel the cold more bitterly. Gabiwabikoke was suffering
badly from its effects and was entirely played out. We had already
drifted more than a mile beyond the light-house point. John Baptist and
I continued paddling steadily and vigorously, and felt relieved and
encouraged when we saw the shore draw near and nearer. The ice-field, by
this time, was miles away to the northeast, and a sea was getting up. At
last, just when the sun was setting, only a few yards separated us from
the shore; three more paddle-strokes and our raft ran up against the
beach. We were safe.</p>

<p>He placed one hand on my breast, the other on his own, then clasped
his two hands together after the manner of our
congratulations&mdash;<i>We are friends</i>, Fig. 320. He placed one
hand on me, the other on himself, then placed the first two fingers of
his right hand between his lips&mdash;<i>We are brothers</i>. He placed
his right hand over my heart, his left hand over his own heart, then
linked the first fingers of his right and left hands&mdash;<i>Our hearts
are linked together</i>. See <a href = "#fig232">Fig. 232</a>,
p.&nbsp;386. He laid his right hand on me lightly, then put it to his
mouth, with the knuckles lightly against his lips, and made the motion
of flipping water from the right-hand forefinger, each flip casting the
hand and arm from the mouth a foot or so, then bringing it back in the
same position. (This repeated three or more times, signifying
<i>talk</i> or <i>talking</i>.) Fig. 321. He then made a motion with his
right hand as if he were fanning his right ear; this repeated. He then
extended his right hand with his index finger pointing upward, his eyes
also being turned upward&mdash;<i>You told me of the Great Father</i>.
Pointing to himself, he hugged both hands to his bosom, as if he were
affectionately clasping something he loved, and then pointed upward in
the way before described&mdash;<i>I love him</i> (the Great Father).
Laying his right hand on me, he clasped his hands to his bosom as
before&mdash;<i>I love you</i>. Placing his right hand on my shoulder,
he threw it over his own right shoulder as if he were casting behind him
a little chip, only when his hand was over his shoulder his index finger
was pointing behind him&mdash;<i>You go away</i>. Pointing to his
breast, he clinched the same hand as if it held a stick, and made a
motion as if he were trying to strike something on the ground with the
bottom of the stick held in an upright position&mdash;<i>I stay</i>, or
<i>I stay right here</i>, Fig. 322.</p>

<p>Placing his right hand on me, he placed both his hands on his breast
and breathed deeply two or three times, then using the index finger and
thumb of each hand as if he were holding a small pin, he placed the two
hands in this position as if he were holding a thread in each hand and
between the thumb and forefinger of each hand close together, and
<span class = "pagenum">522</span>
<a name = "page522" id = "page522"> </a>
then let his hands recede from each other, still holding his fingers in
the same position, as if he were letting a thread slip between them
until his hands were two feet apart&mdash;<i>You live long time</i>,
Fig. 323. Laying his right hand on his breast, then extending his
forefinger of the same hand, holding it from him at half-arm’s length,
the finger pointing nearly upward, then moving his hand, with the finger
thus extended, from side to side about as rapidly as a man steps in
walking, each time letting his hand get farther from him for three or
four times, then suddenly placing his left hand in a horizontal position
with the fingers extended and together so that the palm was sidewise, he
used the right-hand palm extended, fingers together, as a hatchet, and
brought it down smartly, just missing the ends of the fingers of the
left hand, Fig. 324. Then placing his left hand, with the thumb and
forefinger closed, to his heart, he brought his right hand, fingers in
the same position, to his left, then, as if he were holding something
between his thumb and forefinger, he moved his right hand away as if he
were slowly casting a hair from him, his left hand remaining at his
breast, and his eyes following his right&mdash;<i>I go about a little
while longer, but will be cut off shortly and my spirit will go away</i>
(or&nbsp;will die). Placing the thumbs and forefingers again in such a
position as if he held a small thread between the thumb and forefinger
of each hand, and the hands touching each other, he drew his hands
slowly from each other, as if he were stretching a piece of gum-elastic;
then laying his right hand on me, he extended the left hand in a
horizontal position, fingers extended and closed, and brought down his
right hand with fingers extended and together, so as to just miss the
tips of the fingers of his left hand; then placing his left forefinger
and thumb against his heart, he acted as if he took a hair from the
forefinger and thumb of his left hand with the forefinger and thumb of
the right, and slowly cast it from him, only letting his left hand
remain at his breast, and let the index finger of the right hand point
outward toward the distant horizon&mdash;<i>After a long time you
die</i>. When placing his left hand upon himself and his right hand upon
me, he extended them upward over his head and clasped them
there&mdash;<i>We then meet in heaven</i>. Pointing upward, then to
himself, then to me, he closed the third and little finger of his right
hand, laying his thumb over them, then extending his first and second
fingers about as far apart as the eyes, he brought his hand to his eyes,
fingers pointing outward,
<span class = "pagenum">523</span>
<a name = "page523" id = "page523"> </a>
and shot his hand outward&mdash;<i>I see you up there</i>. Pointing to
me, then giving the last above-described sign of <i>look</i>, then
pointing to himself, he made the sign as if stretching out a piece of
gum-elastic between the fingers of his left and right hands, and then
made the sign of <i>cut-off</i> before described, and then extended the
palm of the right hand horizontally a foot from his waist, inside
downward, then suddenly threw it half over and from him, as if you were
to toss a chip from the back of the hand (this is the negative sign
everywhere used among these Indians)&mdash;<i>I would see him a long
time, which should never be cut off</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>always.</i></p>

<p>Pointing upward, then rubbing the back of his left hand lightly with
the forefinger of his right, he again gave the negative sign<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has superfluous .">.&mdash;</ins><i>No Indian
there</i> (in&nbsp;heaven). Pointing upward, then rubbing his forefinger
over the back of my hand, he again made the negative sign&mdash;<i>No
white man there</i>. He made the same sign again, only he felt his hair
with the forefinger and thumb of his right hand, rolling the hair
several times between the fingers&mdash;<i>No black man in heaven</i>.
Then rubbing the back of his hand and making the negative sign, rubbing
the back of my hand and making the negative sign, feeling of one of his
hairs with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand, and making the
negative sign, then using both hands as if he were reaching around a
hogshead, he brought the forefinger of his right hand to the front in an
upright position after their manner of counting, and said
thereby&mdash;<i>No Indian, no white man, no black man, all one</i>.
Making the “hogshead” sign, and that for <i>look</i>, he placed the
forefinger of each hand side by side pointing upward&mdash;<i>All look
the same</i>, or <ins class = "correction" title =
"printed in plain (non-Italic) type"><i>alike</i></ins>.
Running his hands over his wild
Indian costume and over my clothes, he made the “hogshead” sign, and
that for <i>same</i>, and said thereby&mdash;<i>All dress alike
there</i>. Then making the “hogshead” sign, and that for <i>love</i>,
(hugging his hands), he extended both hands outward, palms turned
downward, and made a sign exactly similar to the way ladies smooth a bed
in making it; this is the sign for <i>happy</i>&mdash;<i>All will be
happy alike there</i>. He then made the sign for <i>talk</i> and for
<i>Father</i>, pointing to himself and to me&mdash;<i>You pray for
me</i>. He then made the sign for <i>go away</i>, pointing to me, he
threw right hand over his right shoulder so his index finger pointed
behind him&mdash;<i>You go away</i>. Calling his name he made the sign
for <i>look</i> and the sign of <i>negation</i> after pointing to
me&mdash;<i>Kin Chē-ĕss see you no more</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Notes.</span>&mdash;As will be seen, the
word <i>timber</i> is composed of signs No. 1&nbsp;and 2, signifying
<i>trees standing</i>. Sign No. 3, for <i>many</i>, in this instance, as
in similar other examples, becomes <i>much</i>. The word “in,” in
connection with <i>country</i> and <i>my</i>, is expressed by the
gesture of pointing (passing the hand less quickly than in ordinary sign
language) before making sign No.&nbsp;5. That sign commonly given for
<i>possession</i>, would, without the prefix of indication, imply <i>my
country</i>, and with that prefix signifies <i>in my country</i>. Sign
No.&nbsp;7, <i>trimmed</i>, is indicated by chopping off the ends, and
facial expression denoting <i>satisfaction</i>. In sign Nos. 11 and 12
the gestures were continuous, but at the termination of the latter the
narrator straightened himself somewhat, denoting that he had overcome
the greater part of the labor. Sign No. 14 denotes <i>log-house</i>,
from the manner of interlacing the finger-ends, thus representing the
corner of a log-house, and the arrangement of the ends of the same.
<i>Indian lodge</i> would be indicated by another sign, although the
latter is often used as an abbreviation for the former, when the subject
of conversation is known to all present.</p>

SIGNALS.</a></h3>

<p>The collaborators in the work above explained have not generally
responded to the request to communicate material under this head. It is,
however, hoped that by now printing some extracts from published works
and the few contributions recently procured, the attention of observers
will be directed to the prosecution of research in this direction.</p>

<p>The term “signal” is here used in distinction from the signs noted in
the <span class = "smallcaps">Dictionary</span>, extracts from which are
given above, as being some action or manifestation intended to be seen
at a distance, and not allowing of the minuteness or detail possible in
close converse. Signals may be executed, first, exclusively by bodily
action; second, by action of the person in connection with objects, such
as a blanket, or a lance, or the direction imparted to a horse; third,
by various devices, such as smoke, fire or dust, when the person of the
signalist is not visible. When not simply intended to attract attention
they are generally conventional, and while their study has not the same
kind of importance as that of gesture signs, it possesses some peculiar
interest.</p>

<p>The right hand is to be advanced about eighteen inches at the height
of the navel, horizontal, relaxed, palm downward, thumb in the palm;
then draw it near the side and at the same time drop the hand to bring
the palm backward. The farther away the person called is, the higher the
hand is raised. If very far off, the hand is raised high up over the
head and then swung forward, downward, and backward to the side.

<p>The United States steamer Saranac in 1874, cruising in Alaskan
waters, dropped anchor in July, 1874, in Freshwater Harbor, back of
Sitka, in latitude 59° north. An armed party landed at a T’linkit
village, deserted by all the inhabitants except one old man and two
women, the latter seated at the feet of the former. The man was in great
fear, turned his back and held up his hands as a sign of utter
helplessness. (Extract from notes kindly furnished by

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Discovery.</h5>

<p>The discovery of enemies, game, or anything else, is announced by
riding rapidly to and fro, or in a circle. The idea that there is a
difference in the signification of these two directions of riding
appears, according to many of the Dakota Indians of the Missouri Valley,
to be erroneous. Parties away from their regular encampment are
generally in search of some special object, such as game, or of another
party, either friendly or hostile, which is generally understood, and
when that object is found, the announcement is made to their companions
in either of the above ways. The reason that a horseman may ride from
side to side is, that the party to whom he desires to communicate may be
at a particular locality, and his movement&mdash;at right angles to the
direction to the party&mdash;would be perfectly clear. Should the party
be separated into smaller bands, or have flankers or scouts at various
points, the only way in which the rider’s signal could be recognized as
a motion from side to side, by all the persons to whom the signal was
directed, would be for him to ride in a circle, which he naturally does.

<p>The latter was noticed by Dr. Hoffman in 1873, on the Yellowstone
River, while attached to the Stanley Expedition. The Indians had again
concentrated after their first repulse by General Custer, and taken
possession of the woods and bluffs on the opposite side of the river. As
the column came up, one Indian was seen upon a high bluff to ride
rapidly round in a circle, occasionally firing off his revolver. The
signal announced the discovery of the advancing force, which had been
expected, and he could be distinctly seen from the surrounding region.
As many of the enemy were still scattered over the neighborhood, some of
them would not have been able to recognize this signal had he ridden to
and from an observer, but the circle produced a lateral movement visible
from any point.</p>

<p>The discovery of enemies is indicated by riding rapidly around in a
circle, so that the signal could be seen by their friends, but out of
sight of the discovered enemy. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>When enemies are discovered, or other game than buffalo, the sentinel
waves his blanket over his head up and down, holding an end in each
hand. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Ponka</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; Of game, wood, water, &amp;c.</h5>

<p>This is communicated by riding rapidly forward and backward on the
top of the highest hill. The same would be communicated with a blanket
by waving it right and left, and then directly toward the game or
whatever the party might be searching for, indicating that it is not to
the right or to the left, but directly in front.

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Drill, Military.</h5>

<p>“It is done by signals, devised after a system of the Indian’s own
invention, and communicated in various ways.</p>

<p>“Wonderful as the statement may appear, the signaling on a bright
day, when the sun is in the proper direction, is done with a piece of
looking-glass held in the hollow of the hand. The reflection of the
sun’s rays thrown on the ranks communicates in some mysterious way the
wishes of the chief. Once standing on a little knoll overlooking the
valley of the South Platte, I&nbsp;witnessed almost at my feet a drill
of about one hundred warriors by a Sioux chief, who sat on his horse on
a knoll opposite me, and about two hundred yards from his command in the
plain below. For more than half an hour he commanded a drill, which for
variety and promptness of action could not be equaled by any civilized
cavalry of the world. All I could see was an occasional movement of the
right arm. He himself afterwards told me that he used a looking-glass.”

308.)</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Friendship.</h5>

<p>If two Indians [of the plains] are approaching one another on
horseback, and they may, for instance, be one mile apart, or as far as
they can see each other. At that safe distance one wants to indicate to
the other that he wishes to be friendly. He does this by turning his
horse around and traveling about fifty paces back and forth, repeating
this two or three times; this shows to the other Indian that he is not
for hostility, but for friendly relations. If the second Indian accepts
this proffered overture of friendship, he indicates the same by locking
the fingers of both hands as far as to the first joints, and in that
position raises his hands and lets them rest on his forehead with the
palms
<span class = "pagenum">535</span>
<a name = "page535" id = "page535"> </a>
either in or out, indifferently, as if he were trying to shield his eyes
from the excessive light of the sun. This implies, “I, too, am for
peace,” or “I&nbsp;accept your overture.” (<i>Sac, Fox, and
Kickapoo</i>&nbsp;I.) It is interesting in this connection to note the
reception of Father Marquette by an Illinois chief who is reported to
have raised his hands to his eyes as if to shield them from overpowering
splendor. That action was supposed to be made in a combination of
humility and admiration, and a pretended inability to gaze on the face
of the illustrious guest has been taken to be the conception of the
gesture, which in fact was probably only the holding the interlocked
hands in the most demonstrative posture. An oriental gesture in which
the flat hand is actually interposed as a shield to the eyes before a
superior is probably made with the poetical conception erroneously
attributed to the Indian.</p>

<p>The display of green branches to signalize friendly or pacific
intentions does not appear to have been noticed among the North American
Indians by trustworthy observers. Captain Cook makes frequent mention of
it as the ceremonial greeting among islands he visited. See his
<i>Voyage toward the South Pole</i>. <i>London</i>, 1784, Vol. II, pp.
30 and 35. Green branches were also waved in signal of <i>friendship</i>
by the natives of the island of New Britain to the members of the
expedition in charge of Mr. Wilfred Powell in 1878. <i>Proceedings of
the Royal Geological Society</i>, February, 1881, p.&nbsp;89.</p>

SMOKE SIGNALS GENERALLY.</a></h4>

<p>They [the Indians] had abandoned the coast, along which bale-fires
were left burning and sending up their columns of smoke to advise the
distant bands of the arrival of their old enemy. (Schoolcraft’s
<i>History</i>, &amp;c., vol. iii, p.&nbsp;35, giving a condensed
account of De Soto’s expedition.)</p>

<p>“Their systems of telegraphs are very peculiar, and though they might
seem impracticable at first, yet so thoroughly are they understood by
the savages that it is availed of frequently to immense advantage. The
most remarkable is by raising smokes, by which many important facts are
communicated to a considerable distance and made intelligible by the
manner, size, number, or repetition of the smokes, which are
<span class = "pagenum">537</span>
<a name = "page537" id = "page537"> </a>
commonly raised by firing spots of dry grass.” (Josiah Gregg’s
<i>Commerce of the Prairies</i>. <i>New York</i>, 1844, vol. ii,
p.&nbsp;286.)</p>

<p>The highest elevations of land are selected as stations from which
signals with smoke are made. These can be seen at a distance of from
twenty to fifty miles. By varying the number of columns of smoke
different meanings are conveyed. The most simple as well as the most
varied mode, and resembling the telegraphic alphabet, is arranged by
building a small fire, which is not allowed to blaze; then by placing an
armful of partially green grass or weeds over the fire, as if to smother
it, a&nbsp;dense white smoke is created, which ordinarily will ascend in
a continuous vertical column for hundreds of feet. Having established a
current of smoke, the Indian simply takes his blanket and by spreading
it over the small pile of weeds or grass from which the smoke takes its
source, and properly controlling the edges and corners of the blanket,
he confines the smoke, and is in this way able to retain it for several
moments. By rapidly displacing the blanket, the operator is enabled to
cause a dense volume of smoke to rise, the length or shortness of which,
as well as the number and frequency of the columns, he can regulate
perfectly, simply by a proper use of the blanket. (Custer’s <i>My Life
on the Plains</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p.&nbsp;187.)</p>

<p>They gathered an armful of dried grass and weeds, which were placed
and carried upon the highest point of the peak, where, everything being
in readiness, the match was applied close to the ground; but the blaze
was no sooner well lighted and about to envelop the entire amount of
grass collected than it was smothered with the unlighted portion.
A&nbsp;slender column of gray smoke then began to ascend in a
perpendicular column. This was not enough, as it might be taken for the
smoke rising from a simple camp-fire. The smoldering grass was then
covered with a blanket, the corners of which were held so closely to the
ground as to almost completely confine and cut off the column of smoke.
Waiting a few moments, until the smoke was beginning to escape from
beneath, the blanket was suddenly thrown aside, when a beautiful
balloon-shaped column puffed upward like the white cloud of smoke which
attends the discharge of a field-piece. Again casting the blanket on the
pile of grass, the column was interrupted as before, and again in due
time released, so that a succession of elongated, egg-shaped puffs of
smoke kept ascending toward the sky in the most regular manner. This
bead-like column of smoke, considering the height from which it began to
ascend, was visible from points on the level plain fifty miles distant.

<p>“Columns of smoke rose over the country at scattered

struck, and to tell them to be on their guard,” p.&nbsp;268, 269. This

“Diggers,” probably Chemehuevas.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Arrival of a party at an appointed place, when

<p>This is made by sending upward one column of smoke from a fire
partially smothered by green grass. This is only used by previous
agreement, and if seen by friends of the party, the signal is answered
in the same manner. But should either party discover the presence of
enemies, no signal would be made, but the fact would be communicated by
a runner. (<i>Dakota</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Success of a war party.</h5>

<p>Whenever a war party, consisting of either Pima, Papago, or Maricopa
Indians, returned from an expedition into the Apache country, their
success was announced from the first and most distant elevation visible
from their settlements. The number of scalps secured was shown by a
corresponding number of columns of smoke, arranged in a horizontal line,
side by side, so as to be distinguishable by the observers. When the
returning party was unsuccessful, no such signals were made. (<i>Pima
and Papago</i>&nbsp;I.) Fig. 339. A&nbsp;similar custom appears to have
existed among the Ponkas, although the custom has apparently been
discontinued by them, as shown in the following proper name: Cú-de

SMOKE SIGNALS OF THE APACHES.</a></h4>

<p>The following information was obtained by Dr. <span class =
"smallcaps">W. J. Hoffman</span> from the Apache chiefs named on page
407, under the title of <span class = "smallcaps">Tinnean</span>,
(<i>Apache</i>&nbsp;I):</p>

<p>The materials used in making smoke of sufficient density and color
consist of pine or cedar boughs, leaves and grass, which can nearly
always be obtained in the regions occupied by the Apaches of Northern
New Mexico. These Indians state that they employ but three kinds of
signals, each of which consists of columns of smoke, numbering from one
to three or more.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Alarm.</h5>

<p>This signal is made by causing three or more columns of smoke to
ascend, and signifies danger or the approach of an enemy, and also
requires the concentration of those who see them. These signals are
communicated from one camp to another, and the most distant bands are
guided by their location. The greater the haste desired the greater
<span class = "pagenum">539</span>
<a name = "page539" id = "page539"> </a>
the number of columns of smoke. These are often so hastily made that
they may resemble puffs of smoke, and are caused by throwing heaps of
grass and leaves upon the embers again and again.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Attention.</h5>

<p>This signal is generally made by producing one continuous column, and
signifies attention for several purposes, viz, when a band had become
tired of one locality, or the grass may have been consumed by the
ponies, or some other cause necessitated removal, or should an enemy be
reported, which would require farther watching before a decision as to
future action would be made. The intention or knowledge of anything
unusual would be communicated to neighboring bands by causing one column
of smoke to ascend.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Establishment of a camp; Quiet; Safety.</h5>

<p>When a removal of camp has been made, after the signal for <span
class = "smallcaps">Attention</span> has been given, and the party have
selected a place where they propose to remain until there may be a
necessity or desire for their removal, two columns of smoke are made, to
inform their friends that they propose to remain at that place. Two
columns are also made at other times during a long continued residence,
to inform the neighboring bands that a camp still exists, and that all
is favorable and quiet.</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_signals_foreign" id = "sign_signals_foreign">
FOREIGN SMOKE SIGNALS.</a></h4>

<p>The following examples of smoke signals in foreign lands are added
for comparison.</p>

<p>Miss Haigh, speaking of the Guanches of the Canary Islands at the
time of the Spanish conquest, says: “When an enemy approached, they
alarmed the country by raising a thick smoke or by whistling, which was
repeated from one to another. This latter method is still in use among
the people of Teneriffe, and may be heard at an almost incredible
distance.” (<i>Trans. Eth. Soc. Lond.</i> vii, 1869, sec. ser., pp. 109,
110.)</p>

<p>“The natives have an easy method of telegraphing news to their
distant friends. When Sir Thomas Mitchell was traveling through Eastern
Australia he often saw columns of smoke ascending through the trees in
the forests, and he soon learned that the natives used the smoke of
fires for the purpose of making known his movements to their friends.
Near Mount Frazer he observed a dense column of smoke, and subsequently
other smokes arose, extending in a telegraphic line far to the south,
along the base of the mountains, and thus communicating to the natives
who might be upon his route homeward the tidings of his return.</p>

<p>“When Sir Thomas reached Portland Bay he noticed that when a whale
appeared in the bay the natives were accustomed to send up a column
<span class = "pagenum">540</span>
<a name = "page540" id = "page540"> </a>
of smoke, thus giving timely intimation to all the whalers. If the whale
should be pursued by one boat’s crew only it might be taken; but if
pursued by several, it would probably be run ashore and become food for
the blacks.” (Smyth, <i>loc. cit.</i>, vol. 1, pp. 152, 153, quoting
Maj. T.&nbsp;L. Mitchell’s <i>Eastern Australia</i>, vol. ii,
p.&nbsp;241.)</p>

<p>Jardine, writing of the natives of Cape York, says that a
“communication between the islanders and the natives of the mainland is
frequent; and the rapid manner in which news is carried from tribe to
tribe, to great distances, is astonishing. I&nbsp;was informed of the
approach of Her Majesty’s Steamer Salamander, on her last visit, two
days before her arrival here. Intelligence is conveyed by means of fires
made to throw up smoke in different forms, and by messengers who perform
long and rapid journeys.” (Smyth, <i>loc. cit.</i>, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;153,
quoting from <i>Overland Expedition</i>, p.&nbsp;85.)</p>

<p>Messengers in all parts of Australia appear to have used this mode of
signaling. In Victoria, when traveling through the forests, they were
accustomed to raise smoke by filling the hollow of a tree with green
boughs and setting fire to the trunk at its base; and in this way, as
they always selected an elevated position for the fire when they could,
their movements were made known.</p>

<p>When engaged in hunting, when traveling on secret expeditions, when
approaching an encampment, when threatened with danger, or when foes
menaced their friends, the natives made signals by raising a smoke. And
their fires were lighted in such a way as to give forth signals that
would be understood by people of their own tribe and by friendly tribes.
They exhibited great ability in managing their system of telegraphy; and
in former times it was not seldom used to the injury of the white
settlers, who at first had no idea that the thin column of smoke rising
through the foliage of the adjacent bush, and raised perhaps by some
feeble old woman, was an intimation to the warriors to advance and
attack the Europeans. (R.&nbsp;Brough Smyth, F.L.S., F.G.S., <i>The
Aborigines of Victoria</i>. <i>Melbourne</i>, 1878, vol. i, pp. 152,
153.)</p>

FIRE ARROWS.</a></h4>

<p>“Travelers on the prairie have often seen the Indians throwing up
signal lights at night, and have wondered how it was done. <span class =
"ellipsis">***</span> They take off the head of the arrow and dip the
shaft in gunpowder, mixed with glue. <span class = "ellipsis">***</span>
The gunpowder adheres to the wood, and coats it three or four inches
from its end to the depth of one-fourth of an inch. Chewed bark mixed
with dry gunpowder is then fastened to the stick, and the arrow is ready
for use. When it is to be fired, a&nbsp;warrior places it on his
bowstring and draws his bow ready to let it fly; the point of the arrow
is then lowered, another warrior lights the dry bark, and it is shot
high in the air. When it has gone up a little
<span class = "pagenum">541</span>
<a name = "page541" id = "page541"> </a>
distance, it bursts out into a flame, and burns brightly until it falls
to the ground. Various meanings are attached to these fire-arrow
signals. Thus, one arrow meant, among the Santees, ‘The enemy are
about’; two arrows from the same point, ‘Danger’; three, ‘Great danger’;
many, ‘They are too strong, or we are falling back’; two arrows sent up
at the same moment, ‘We will attack’; three, ‘Soon’; four, ‘Now’; if
shot diagonally, ‘In that direction.’ These signals are constantly
changed, and are always agreed upon when the party goes out or before it
separates. The Indians send their signals very intelligently, and seldom
make mistakes in telegraphing each other by these silent monitors. The
amount of information they can communicate by fires and burning arrows
is perfectly wonderful. Every war party carries with it bundles of
signal arrows.” (<i>Belden</i>, <i>The White Chief; or Twelve Years
among the Wild Indians of the Plains</i>. <i>Cincinnati and New
York</i>, 1871, pp. 106, 107.)</p>

<p>With regard to the above, it is possible that white influence has
been felt in the mode of signaling as well as in the use of gunpowder,
but it would be interesting to learn if any Indians adopted a similar
expedient before gunpowder was known to them. They frequently used
arrows, to which flaming material was attached, to set fire to the
wooden houses of the early colonists. The Caribs were acquainted with
this same mode of destruction as appears by the following quotation:</p>

<p>“Their arrows were commonly poisoned, except when they made their
military excursions by night; on these occasions they converted them
into instruments of still greater mischief; for, by arming the points
with pledgets of cotton dipped in oil, and set on fire, they fired whole
villages of their enemies at a distance.” (<i>Alcedo</i>. <i>The
Geograph. and Hist. Dict. of America and the West Indies</i>. Thompson’s
trans. <i>London</i>, 1812, Vol. I, p.&nbsp;314.)</p>


<h4><a name = "sign_signals_dust" id = "sign_signals_dust">
DUST SIGNALS.</a></h4>

<p>When an enemy, game, or anything else which was the special object of
search is discovered, handfulls of dust are thrown into the air to
announce that discovery. This signal has the same general signification
as when riding to and fro, or, round in a circle on an elevated portion
of ground, or a bluff. (<i>Dakota</i> VII, VII.)</p>

<p>When any game or any enemy is discovered, and should the sentinel be
without a blanket, he throws a handful of dust up into the air. When the
Brulés attacked the Ponkas, in 1872, they stood on the bluff and threw
up dust. (<i>Omaha</i>&nbsp;I; <i>Ponka</i>&nbsp;I.)</p>

<p>There appears to be among the Bushmen a custom of throwing up sand or
earth into the air when at a distance from home and in need of help of
some kind from those who were there. (<i>Miss L.&nbsp;C. Lloyd</i><ins

Letter</i>, dated July 10, 1880, from Charlton House, Mowbray, near Cape
Town, Africa.)</p>

NOTES ON CHEYENNE AND ARAPAHO SIGNALS.</a></h4>

<p>The following information was obtained from <span class =

"smallcaps">Mo-hi´-nuk´-ma-ha´-it</span> (<i>Big Horse</i>), Cheyennes,

"smallcaps">Na´-watc</span> (<i>Left Hand</i>), Arapahos, chiefs and
members of a delegation who visited Washington, D.C., in September,
1880, in the interest of their tribes dwelling in Indian Territory:</p>

<p>A party of Indians going on the war-path leave camp, announcing their
project to the remaining individuals and informing neighboring friends
by sending runners. A&nbsp;party is not systematically organized until
several days away from its headquarters, unless circumstances should
require immediate action. The pipe-bearers are appointed, who precede
the party while on the march, carrying the pipes, and no one is allowed
to cross ahead of these individuals, or to join the party by riding up
before the head of the column, as it would endanger the success of the
expedition. All new arrivals fall in from either side or the rear. Upon
coming in sight of any elevations of land likely to afford a good view
of the surrounding country the warriors come to a halt and secrete
themselves as much as possible. The scouts who have already been
selected, advance just before daybreak to within a moderate distance of
the elevation to ascertain if any of the enemy has preceded them. This
is only discovered by carefully watching the summit to see if any
objects are in motion; if not, the flight of birds is observed, and if
any should alight upon the hill or butte it would indicate the absence
of anything that might ordinarily scare them away. Should a large bird,
as a raven, crow, or eagle, fly toward the hill-top and make a sudden
swerve to either side and disappear, it would indicate the presence of
something sufficient to require further examination. When it is learned
that there is reason to suspect an enemy the scout, who has all the time
been closely watched by the party in the rear, makes a signal for them
to lie still, signifying <i>danger or caution</i>. It is made by
grasping the blanket with the right hand and waving it earthward from a
position in front of and as high as the shoulder. This is nearly the
same as civilized Americans use the hand for a similar purpose in battle
or hunting to direct “lie quiet”!</p>

<p>Should the hill, however, be clear of any one, the Indian will ascend
slowly, and under cover as much as possible, and gain a view of the
country. If there is no one to be seen, the blanket is grasped and waved
horizontally from right to left and back again repeatedly, showing a
clear surface. If the enemy is discovered, the scout will give the
<i>alarm</i> by running down the hill, upon a side visible to the
watchers, in a zigzag manner, which communicates the state of
affairs.</p>

<p>Should any expedition or advance be attempted at night, the same
signals as are made with the blanket are made with a firebrand, which is
constructed of a bunch of grass tied to a short pole.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">543</span>
<a name = "page543" id = "page543"> </a>
<p>When a war party encamps for a night or a day or more, a piece of
wood is stuck into the ground, pointing in the direction pursued, with a
number of cuts, notches, or marks corresponding to the number of days
which the party spent after leaving the last camp until leaving the
present camp, serving to show to the recruits to the main party the
course to be followed, and the distance.</p>

<p>A hunting party in advancing takes the same precautions as a war
party, so as not to be surprised by an enemy. If a scout ascends a
prominent elevation and discovers no game, the blanket is grasped and
waved horizontally from side to side at the height of the shoulders or
head; and if game is discovered the Indian rides back and forth (from
left to right) a&nbsp;short distance so that the distant observers can
view the maneuver. If a large herd of buffalo is found, the extent
traveled over in going to and fro increases in proportion to the size of
the herd. A&nbsp;quicker gait is traveled when the herd is very large or
haste on the part of the hunters is desired.</p>

<p>It is stated that these Indians also use mirrors to signal from one
elevation to another, but the system could not be learned, as they say
they have no longer use for it, having ceased warfare (?).</p>

SCHEME OF ILLUSTRATION.</a></h3>

<p>In the following pages the scheme of graphic illustration, intended
both to save labor and secure accuracy, which was presented in the
<i>Introduction to the Study of Sign Language</i>, is reproduced with
some improvements. It is given for the use of observers who may not see
that publication, the material parts of which being included in the
present paper it is not necessary that the former should now be
furnished. The <span class = "smallcaps">Types of Hand Positions</span>
were prepared for reference by the corresponding letters of the alphabet
to avoid tedious description, should any of them exactly correspond, or
by alteration, as suggested in the note following them. These, as well
as the <span class = "smallcaps">Outlines of Arm Positions</span>,
giving front and side outlines with arms pendant, were distributed in
separate sheets to observers for their convenience in recording, and
this will still be cheerfully done when request is made to the present
writer. When the sheets are not accessible the <span class =
"smallcaps">Types</span> can be used for graphic changes by tracing the
one selected, or by a few words indicating the change, as shown in the
<span class = "smallcaps">Examples</span>. The <span class =
"smallcaps">Outlines of Arm Positions</span> can also be readily traced
for the same use as if the sheets had been provided. It is hoped that
this scheme, promoting uniformity in description and illustration, will
be adopted by all observers who cannot be specially addressed.</p>

<p>Collaborators in the gestures of foreign uncivilized peoples will
confer a favor by sending at least one photograph or sketch in native
costume of a typical individual of the tribe, the gestures of which are
reported upon, in order that it may be reproduced in the complete work.
Such photograph or sketch need not be made in the execution of any
particular gesture, which can be done by artists engaged on the work,
but would be still more acceptable if it could be so made.</p>

<p>The gestures, to be indicated by corrected positions of arms and by
dotted lines showing the motion from the initial to the final positions
(which are severally marked by an arrow-head and a cross&mdash;see <span
class = "smallcaps">Examples</span>), will always be shown as they
appear to an observer facing the gesturer, the front outline, Fig. 340,
or side, Fig. 341, or both, being used as most convenient. The special
positions of hands and fingers will be designated by reference to the
<span class = "smallcaps">Types of Hand Positions</span>. For brevity in
the written description, “hand” may be used for “right hand,” when that
one alone is employed in any particular gesture. When more convenient to
use the profile figure in which the right arm is exhibited for a gesture
actually made by the left hand and arm it can be done, the fact,
however, being noted.</p>

<p>In cases where the conception or origin of any sign is ascertained or
suggested it should be annexed to the description, and when obtained
from the gesturer will be so stated affirmatively, otherwise it will be

<h6>NOTE CONCERNING THE FOREGOING TYPES.</h6>

<p>The positions are given as they appear to an observer facing the
gesturer, and are designed to show the relations of the fingers to the
hand rather than the positions of the hand relative to the body, which
must be shown by the outlines (see <span class = "smallcaps">Outlines of
Arm Positions</span>) or description. The right and left hands are
figured above without discrimination, but in description or reference
the right hand will be understood when the left is not specified. The
hands as figured can also with proper intimation be applied with changes
either upward, downward, or inclined to either side, so long as the
relative positions of the fingers are retained, and when in that respect
no one of the types exactly corresponds with a sign observed,
modifications may be made by pen or pencil on that one of the types, or
a tracing of it, found most convenient, as indicated in the <span class
= "smallcaps">Examples</span>, and referred to by the letter of the
alphabet under the type changed, with the addition of a
numeral&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, A&nbsp;1, and if that type, <i>i.e.</i>, A,
were changed a second time by the observer (which change would
necessarily be drawn on another sheet of types or another tracing of a
type selected when there are no sheets provided), it should be referred
to as A&nbsp;2.</p>
