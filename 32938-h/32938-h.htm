<div class = "mynote">

<p><a name = "start" id = "start">This text</a> includes characters
that require UTF-8 (Unicode) file encoding:</p>

<div class = "list">
<p>Ē ā ē ī ō ū (vowel with macron or “long” mark)</p>
<p>Ă Ĕ Ĭ ă ĕ ĭ ŏ (vowel with breve or “short” mark)</p>
<p>Ś ś ć (s, c with “acute”: mainly in Recording Indian Languages
article)</p>
<p>ⁿ (small raised n, representing nasalized vowel)</p>
<p>ɔ ʇ ʞ (inverted letters)</p>
<p>‖ (double vertical line</p>
</div>

<p>There are also a handful of Greek words; transliterations are given
in mouse-hover popups. Some compromises were made to accommodate font
availability:</p>

<div class = "list">
<p>The ordinary “cents” sign <b>¢</b> was used in place of the correct
form <b>ȼ</b>, and bracketed <b>[¢]</b> represents the capital letter
<b>Ȼ</b>.</p>
<p>Turned (rotated) <b>c</b> is represented by <b>ɔ</b> (technically an
open <b>o</b>).</p>
<p>Bracketed <b>[K]</b> and <b>[T]</b> represent upside-down (turned,
rotated) capital <b>K</b> and&nbsp;<b>T</b>.</p>
<p>Inverted <b>V</b> is represented by the Greek letter <span class =
"sans">Λ</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>If your computer has a more appropriate character, and you are
comfortable editing html files, feel free to replace letters
globally.</p>

<p>Syllable stress is represented by an acute accent either on the main
v<b>ó</b>wel or after the <b>syl´</b>lable; inconsistencies are
unchanged. Except for the special characters noted above, brackets are
in the original. Note that in the Sign Language article, hand positions
identified by letter (A,&nbsp;B ... W,&nbsp;Y) are descriptive; they do
not represent a “finger alphabet”.</p>

<hr class = "small">

<p>The First Annual Report includes ten “Accompanying Papers”, all
available from Project Gutenberg as individual e-texts. Except for
Yarrow’s “Mortuary Customs”, updated shortly before the present text,
the separate articles were released between late 2005 and late 2007. For
this combined e-text they have been re-formatted for consistency, and
most illustrations have been replaced. Some articles have been further
modified to include specialized characters shown above, and a few more
typographical errors have been corrected.</p>

<p>For consistency with later Annual Reports, a full List of
Illustrations has been added after the Table of Contents, and each
article has been given its own Table of Contents. In the original, the
Contents were printed <i>only</i> at the beginning of the volume, and
Illustrations were listed <i>only</i> with their respective
articles.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Sir</span>: I have the honor to transmit
herewith the first annual report of the operations of the Bureau of
Ethnology.</p>

<p>By act of Congress, an appropriation was made to continue researches
in North American anthropology, the general direction of which was
confided to yourself. As chief executive officer of the Smithsonian
Institution, you entrusted to me the immediate control of the affairs of
the Bureau. This report, with its appended papers, is designed to
exhibit the methods and results of my administration of this trust.</p>

<p>If any measure of success has been attained, it is largely due to
general instructions received from yourself and the advice you have ever
patiently given me on all matters of importance.</p>

<p>I am indebted to my assistants, whose labors are delineated in the
report, for their industry; hearty co-operation, and enthusiastic love
of the science. Only through their zeal have your plans been
executed.</p>

<p>Much assistance has been rendered the Bureau by a large body of
scientific men engaged in the study of anthropology, some of whose names
have been mentioned in the report and accompanying papers, and others
will be put on record when the subject-matter of their writings is fully
published.</p>

<p>I am, with respect, your obedient servant,</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p>The exploration of the Colorado River of the West, begun in 1869 by
authority of Congressional action, was by the same authority
subsequently continued as the second division of the Geographical and
Geological Survey of the Territories, and, finally, as the Geographical
and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region.</p>

<p>By act of Congress of March 3, 1879, the various geological and
geographical surveys existing at that time were discontinued and the
United States Geological Survey was established.</p>

<p>In all the earlier surveys anthropologic researches among the North
American Indians were carried on. In that branch of the work finally
designated as the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky
Mountain Region, such research constituted an important part of the
work. In the act creating the Geological Survey, provision was made to
continue work in this field under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, on the basis of the methods developed and materials
collected by the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky
Mountain Region.</p>

<p>Under the authority of the act of Congress providing for the
continuation of the work, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
intrusted its management to the former director of
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
the Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region, and a bureau of ethnology was
thus practically organized.</p>

<p>In the Annual Report of the Geographical and Geological Survey of the
Rocky Mountain Region for 1877, the following statement of the condition
of the work at that time appears:</p>


<h5>ETHNOGRAPHIC WORK.</h5>

<div class = "quotation">
<p>During the same office season the ethnographic work was more
thoroughly organized, and the aid of a large number of volunteer
assistants living throughout the country was secured. Mr. W.&nbsp;H.
Dall, of the United States Coast Survey, prepared a paper on the tribes
of Alaska, and edited other papers on certain tribes of Oregon and
Washington Territory. He also superintended the construction of an
ethnographic map to accompany his paper, including on it the latest
geographic determination from all available sources. His long residence
and extended scientific labors in that region peculiarly fitted him for
the task, and he has made a valuable contribution both to ethnology and
geography.</p>

<p>With the same volume was published a paper on the habits and customs
of certain tribes of the State of Oregon and Washington Territory,
prepared by the late Mr. George Gibbs while he was engaged in scientific
work in that region for the government. The volume also contains a
Niskwalli vocabulary with extended grammatic notes, the last great work
of the lamented author.</p>

<p>In addition to the map above mentioned and prepared by Mr. Dall,
a&nbsp;second has been made, embracing the western portion of Washington
Territory and the northern part of Oregon. The map includes the results
of the latest geographic information and is colored to show the
distribution of Indian tribes, chiefly from notes and maps left by Mr.
Gibbs.</p>

<p>The Survey is indebted to the following gentlemen for valuable
contributions to this volume: Gov. J. Furujelm, Lieut. E. De Meulen, Dr.
Wm. F. Tolmie, and Rev. Father Mengarini.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephen Powers, of Ohio, who has spent several years in the study
of the Indians of California, had the year before been engaged to
prepare a paper on that subject. In the mean time at my request he was
employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to travel among these tribes
for the purpose of making collections of Indian arts for the
International Exhibition. This afforded him opportunity of more
thoroughly accomplishing his work in the preparation of the
above-mentioned paper. On his return the new material was incorporated
with the old, and the whole has been printed.</p>

<p>At our earliest knowledge of the Indians of California they were
divided into small tribes speaking diverse languages and belonging to
radically different stocks, and the whole subject was one of great
complexity and interest. Mr. Powers has successfully unraveled the
difficult
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "pagexiii" id = "pagexiii"> </a>
problems relating to the classification and affinities of a very large
number of tribes, and his account of their habits and customs is of much
interest.</p>

<p>In the volume with his paper will be found a number of vocabularies
collected by himself, Mr. George Gibbs, General George Crook, U.S.A.,
General W.&nbsp;B. Hazen, U.S.A., Lieut. Edward Ross, U.S.A., Assistant
Surgeon Thomas F. Azpell, U.S.A., Mr. Ezra Williams, Mr. J.&nbsp;R.
Bartlett, Gov. J. Furujelm, Prof. F.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O. Roehrig, Dr.
William A. Gabb, Mr. H.&nbsp;B. Brown, Mr. Israel S. Diehl, Dr. Oscar
Loew, Mr. Albert S. Gatschet, Mr. Livingston Stone, Mr. Adam Johnson,
Mr. Buckingham Smith, Padre Aroyo; Rev. Father Gregory Mengarini, Padre
Juan Comelias, Hon. Horatio Hale, Mr. Alexander S. Taylor, Rev. Antonio
Timmeno, and Father Bonaventure Sitjar.</p>

<p>The volume is accompanied by a map of the State of California,
compiled from the latest official sources and colored to show the
distribution of linguistic stocks.</p>

<p>The Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, of Maryland, has been engaged for more than
a year in the preparation of a grammar and dictionary of the Ponka
language. His residence among these Indians as a missionary has
furnished him favorable opportunity for the necessary studies, and he
has pushed forward the work with zeal and ability, his only hope of
reward being a desire to make a contribution to science.</p>

<p>Prof. Otis T. Mason, of Columbian College, has for the past year
rendered the office much assistance in the study of the history and
statistics of Indian tribes.</p>

<p>On June 13, Brevet Lieut. Col. Garrick Mallery, U.S.A., at the
request of the Secretary of the Interior, joined my corps under orders
from the honorable Secretary of War, and since that time has been
engaged in the study of the statistics and history of the Indians of the
western portion of the United States.</p>

<p>In April last, Mr. A. S. Gatschet was employed as a philologist to
assist in the ethnographic work of this Survey. He had previously been
engaged in the study of the languages of various North American tribes.
In June last at the request of this office he was employed by the Bureau
of Indian Affairs to collect certain statistics relating to the Indians
of Oregon and Washington Territory, and is now in the field. His
scientific reports have since that time been forwarded through the
honorable Commissioner of Indian Affairs to this office. His work will
be included in a volume now in course of preparation.</p>

<p>Dr. H. O. Yarrow, U.S.A., now on duty at the Army Medical Museum, in
Washington, has been engaged during the past year in the collection of
material for a monograph on the customs and rites of sepulture. To aid
him in this work circulars of inquiry have been widely circulated among
ethnologists and other scholars throughout North America, and much
material has been obtained which will greatly supplement his own
extended observations and researches.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "pagexiv" id = "pagexiv"> </a>
<p>Many other gentlemen throughout the United States have rendered me
valuable assistance in this department of investigation. Their labors
will receive due acknowledgment at the proper time, but I must not fail
to render my sincere thanks to these gentlemen, who have so cordially
and efficiently co-operated with me in this work.</p>

<p>A small volume, entitled “Introduction to the Study of Indian
Languages,” has been prepared and published. This book is intended for
distribution among collectors. In its preparation I have been greatly
assisted by Prof. W.&nbsp;D. Whitney, the distinguished philologist of
Yale College. To him I am indebted for that part relating to the
representation of the sounds of Indian languages; a&nbsp;work which
could not be properly performed by any other than a profound scholar in
this branch.</p>

<p>I complete the statement of the office-work of the past season by
mentioning that a tentative classification of the linguistic families of
the Indians of the United States has been prepared. This has been a work
of great labor, to which I have devoted much of my own time, and in
which I have received the assistance of several of the gentlemen above
mentioned.</p>

<p>In pursuing these ethnographic investigations it has been the
endeavor as far as possible to produce results that would be of
practical value in the administration of Indian affairs, and for this
purpose especial attention has been paid to vital statistics, to the
discovery of linguistic affinities, the progress made by the Indians
toward civilization, and the causes and remedies for the inevitable
conflict that arises from the spread of civilization over a region
previously inhabited by savages. I&nbsp;may be allowed to express the
hope that our labors in this direction will not be void of such useful
results.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1878 no report of the Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region was
published, as before its completion the question of reorganizing all of
the surveys had been raised, but the work was continued by the same
methods as in previous years.</p>

<p>The operations of the Bureau of Ethnology during the past fiscal year
will be briefly described.</p>

<p>In the plan of organization two methods of operation are
embraced:</p>

<p>First. The prosecution of research by the direct employment of
scholars and specialists; and</p>

<p>Second. By inciting and guiding research immediately conducted by
collaborators at work throughout the country.</p>

<p>It has been the effort of the Bureau to prosecute work in the various
branches of North American anthropology on a systematic plan, so that
every important field should be cultivated, limited only by the amount
appropriated by Congress.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<a name = "pagexv" id = "pagexv"> </a>
<p>With little exception all sound anthropologic investigation in the
lower states of culture exhibited by tribes of men, as distinguished
from nations, must have a firm foundation in language Customs, laws,
governments, institutions, mythologies, religions, and even arts can not
be properly understood without a fundamental knowledge of the languages
which express the ideas and thoughts embodied therein. Actuated by these
considerations prime attention has been given to language.</p>

<p>It is not probable that there are many languages in North America
entirely unknown, and in fact it is possible there are none; but of many
of the known languages only short vocabularies have appeared. Except for
languages entirely unknown, the time for the publication of short
vocabularies has passed; they are no longer of value. The Bureau
proposes hereafter to publish short vocabularies only in the exceptional
cases mentioned above.</p>

<p>The distribution of the Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages
is resulting in the collection of a large series of chrestomathies,
which it is believed will be worthy of publication. It is also proposed
to publish grammars and dictionaries when those have been thoroughly and
carefully prepared. In each case it is deemed desirable to connect with
the grammar and dictionary a body of literature designed as texts for
reference in explaining the facts and principles of the language. These
texts will be accompanied by interlinear translations so arranged as
greatly to facilitate the study of the chief grammatic
characteristics.</p>


<h5>BIBLIOGRAPHY OF NORTH AMERICAN PHILOLOGY, BY MR. J. C. PILLING.</h5>

<p>There is being prepared in the office a bibliography of North
American languages. It was originally intended as a card catalogue for
office use, but has gradually assumed proportions which seem to justify
its publication. It is designed as an author’s catalogue, arranged
alphabetically, and is to include
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<a name = "pagexvi" id = "pagexvi"> </a>
titles of grammars, dictionaries, vocabularies, translations of the
scriptures, hymnals, doctrinæ christianæ, tracts, school-books, etc.,
general discussions, and reviews when of sufficient importance; in
short, a&nbsp;catalogue of authors who have written in or upon any of
the languages of North America, with a list of their works.</p>

<p>It has been the aim in preparing this material to make not only full
titles of all the works containing linguistics, but also to exhaust
editions. Whether full titles of editions subsequent to the first will
be printed will depend somewhat on the size of the volume it will make,
there being at present about four thousand five hundred cards, probably
about three thousand titles.</p>

<p>The bibliography is based on the library of the Director, but much
time has been spent in various libraries, public and private, the more
important being the Congressional, Boston Public, Boston Athenæum,
Harvard College, Congregational of Boston, Massachusetts Historical
Society, American Antiquarian Society of Worcester, the John Carter
Brown at Providence, the Watkinson at Hartford, and the American Bible
Society at New York. It is hoped that Mr. Pilling may find opportunity
to visit the principal libraries of New York and Philadelphia,
especially those of the historical societies, before the work is
printed.</p>

<p>In addition to personal research, much correspondence has been
carried on with the various missionaries and Indian agents throughout
the United States and Canada, and with gentlemen who have written upon
the subject, among whom are Dr. H. Rink, of Copenhagen, Dr. J.&nbsp;C.
E. Buschman, of Berlin, and the well-known bibliographers, Mr. J. Sabin,
of New York, Hon. J.&nbsp;R. Bartlett, of Providence, and Señor Don J.
G. Icazbalceta, of the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. Pilling has not attempted to classify the material
linguistically. That work has been left for a future publication,
intended to embody the results of an attempt to classify the tribes of
North America on the basis of language, and now in course of preparation
by the Director.</p>

<h5>LINGUISTIC AND OTHER ANTHROPOLOGIC RESEARCHES, BY THE REV. J. OWEN
DORSEY.</h5>

<p>For a number of years Mr. Dorsey has been engaged in investigations
among a group of cognate Dakotan tribes embracing three languages:
[¢]egiha, spoken by the Ponkas and Omahas, with a closely related
dialect of the same, spoken by the Kansas, Osage, and Kwapa tribes; the
[T]ɔiwere, spoken by the Iowa, Oto, and Missouri tribes; and the
Hotcañgara, spoken by the Winnebago.</p>

<p>In July, 1878, he repaired to the Omaha reservation, in the
neighborhood of which most of these languages are spoken, for the
purpose of continuing his studies.</p>

<p>Mr. Dorsey commenced the study of the [¢]egiha in 1871, and has
continued his researches in the group until the present time. He has
collected a very large body of linguistic material, both in grammar and
vocabulary, and when finally published a great contribution will be made
to North American linguistics.</p>

<p>These languages are excessively complex because of the synthetic
characteristics of the verb, incorporated particles being used in an
elaborate and complex scheme.</p>

<p>In these languages six general classes of pronouns are found:</p>

<div class = "list">
<p>1st. The free personal.</p>
<p>2d. The incorporated personal.</p>
<p>3d. The demonstrative.</p>
<p>4th. The interrogative.</p>
<p>5th. The relative.</p>
<p>6th. The indefinite.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most interesting features of the language is found in the
genders or particle classifiers. The genders or classifiers are
<i>animate</i> and <i>inanimate</i>, and these are again divided into
the <i>standing</i>, <i>sitting</i>, <i>reclining</i>, and
<i>moving</i>; but in the Winnebago the <i>reclining</i> and
<i>moving</i> constitute but one class. They are suffixed to nouns,
pronouns, and verbs. When nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions
are used as predicants, <i>i.e.</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
<a name = "pagexviii" id = "pagexviii"> </a>
to perform the function of verbs, these classifiers are also suffixed.
The classifiers point out with particularity the gender or class of the
subject and object. When numerals are used as nouns the classifiers are
attached.</p>

<p>In nouns and pronouns case functions are performed by an elaborate
system of postpositions in conjunction with the classifiers.</p>

<p>The verbs are excessively complex by reason of the use of many
incorporated particles to denote <i>cause</i>, <i>manner</i>,
<i>instrument</i>, <i>purpose</i>, <i>condition</i>, <i>time</i>, etc.
Voice, mode, and tense are not systematically differentiated in the
morphology, but voices, modes, and tenses, and a great variety of
adverbial qualifications enter into the complex scheme of incorporated
particles.</p>

<p>Sixty-six sounds are found in the [¢]egiha; sixty-two in the
[T]ɔiwere; sixty-two in the Hotcañgara; and the alphabet adopted by the
Bureau is used successfully for their expression.</p>

<p>While Mr. Dorsey has been prosecuting his linguistic studies among
these tribes he has had abundant opportunity to carry on other branches
of anthropologic research, and he has collected extensive and valuable
materials on sociology, mythology, religion, arts, customs, etc. His
final publication of the [¢]egiha will embrace a volume of literature
made up of mythic tales, historical narratives, letters, etc., in the
Indian, with interlinear translations, a&nbsp;selection from which
appears in the papers appended to this report. Another volume will be
devoted to the grammar and a third to the dictionary.</p>


<h5>LINGUISTIC RESEARCHES, BY THE REV. S. R. RIGGS.</h5>

<p>In 1852 the Smithsonian Institution published a grammar and
dictionary of the Dakota language prepared by Mr. Riggs. Since that time
Mr. Riggs, assisted by his sons, A. L. and T. L. Riggs, and by Mr.
Williamson, has been steadily engaged in revising and enlarging the
grammar and dictionary; and at the request of the Bureau he is also
preparing a volume of Dakota literature as texts for illustration to the
grammar and
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
<a name = "pagexix" id = "pagexix"> </a>
dictionary. He is rapidly preparing this work for publication, and it
will soon appear.</p>

<p>The work of Mr. Riggs and that of Mr. Dorsey, mentioned above, with
the materials already published, will place the Dakotan languages on
record more thoroughly than those of any other family in this
country.</p>

<p>The following is a table of the languages of this family now
recognized by the Bureau:</p>

<h5>LINGUISTIC AND GENERAL RESEARCHES AMONG THE KLAMATH INDIANS, BY MR.
A. S. GATSCHET.</h5>

<p>Of the Klamath language of Oregon there are two dialects&mdash;one
spoken by the Indians of Klamath Lake and the other by the
Modocs&mdash;constituting the Lutuami family of Hale and Gallatin.</p>

<p>Mr. Gatschet has spent much time among these Indians, at their
reservation and elsewhere, and has at the present time
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
<a name = "pagexx" id = "pagexx"> </a>
in manuscript nearly ready for the printer a large body of Klamath
literature, consisting of mythic, ethnic, and historic tales,
a&nbsp;grammar and a dictionary. The stories were told by the Indians
and recorded by himself, and constitute a valuable contribution to the
subject. Some specimens will appear in the papers appended to this
report.</p>

<p>The grammatic sketch treats of both dialects, which differ but
slightly in grammar but more in vocabulary. The grammar is divided into
three principal parts: Phonology, Morphology, and Syntax.</p>

<p>In Phonology fifty different sounds are recognized, including simple
and compound consonants, the vowels in different quantities, and the
diphthongs.</p>

<p>A characteristic feature of this language is described in explaining
syllabic reduplication, which performs iterative and distributive
functions. Reduplication for various purposes is found in most of the
languages of North America. In the Nahuatl, Sahaptin, and Selish
families it is most prominent. Mr. Gatschet’s researches will add
materially to the knowledge of the functions of reduplication in tribal
languages.</p>

<p>The verbal inflection is comparatively simple, for in it the subject
and object pronouns are not incorporated. In the verb Mr. Gatschet
recognizes ten general forms, a&nbsp;part of which he designates as
<i>verbals</i>, as follows:</p>

<div class = "list">
<p>&nbsp; 1. Infinitive in -a.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2. Durative in <ins class = "correction" title = "- invisible">-ota</ins>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3. Causative in -oga.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 4. Indefinite in -ash.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 5. Indefinite in -uĭsh.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 6. Conditional in -asht.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 7. Desiderative in -ashtka.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 8. Intentional in -tki.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 9. Participle in -ank.</p>
<p>10. Past participle and verbal adjectives in -tko.</p>
</div>

<p>Tense and mode inflection is very rudimentary and is mostly
accomplished by the use of particles. The study of the prefixes and
suffixes of derivation is one of the chief difficulties of
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
<a name = "pagexxi" id = "pagexxi"> </a>
the language, for they combine in clusters, and are not easily analyzed,
and their functions are often obscure.</p>

<p>The inflection of nouns by case endings and postpositions is rich in
forms; that of the adjective and numeral less elaborate.</p>

<p>Of the pronouns, only the demonstrative show a complexity of
forms.</p>

<p>Another feature of this language is found in verbs appended to
certain numerals, and thus serving as numerical classifiers. These verbs
express methods of counting and relate to form; that is, in each case
they present the Indian in the act of counting objects of a particular
form and placing them in groups of tens.</p>

<p>The appended verbs used as classifiers signify <i>to place</i>, but
in Indian languages we are not apt to find a word so highly
differentiated as <i>place</i>, but in its stead a series of words with
verbs and adverbs undifferentiated, each signifying <i>to place</i>,
with a qualification, as <i>I place upon</i>, <i>I lay alongside of</i>,
<i>I stand up, by</i>, etc. Thus we get classifiers attached to numerals
in the Klamath, analogous to the classifiers attached to verbs, nouns,
numerals, etc., in the Ponka, as mentioned above.</p>

<p>These classifiers in Klamath are further discriminated as to form;
but these form discriminations are the homologues of attitude
discriminations in the Ponka, for the form determines the attitude.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how often in these lower languages attitude
or form is woven into the grammatic structure. Perhaps this arises from
a condition of expression imposed by the want of the verb <i>to be</i>,
so that when existence in place is to be affirmed, the verbs of
attitude, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>to stand</i>, <i>to sit</i>, <i>to lie</i>,
and sometimes <i>to move</i>, are used to predicate existence in place,
and thus the mind comes habitually to consider all things as in the one
or the other of these attitudes. The process of growth seems to be that
verbs of attitude are primarily used to affirm existence in place until
the habit of considering the attitude is established; thus participles
of attitude are used with nouns, &amp;c., and finally, worn down by the
law of phonic change, for economy, they become classifying particles.
This
<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
<a name = "pagexxii" id = "pagexxii"> </a>
view of the origin of classifying particles seems to be warranted by
studies from a great variety of Indian sources.</p>

<p>The syntactic portion is divided into four parts:</p>

<p>1st. On the predicative relation;</p>

<p>2d. On the objective relation;</p>

<p>3d. On the attributive relation; and the</p>

<p>4th. Exhibits the formation of simple and compound sentences,
followed by notes on the incorporative tendency of the language, its
rhetoric, figures, and idioms.</p>

<p>The alphabet adopted by Mr. Gatschet differs slightly from that used
by the Bureau, particularly in the modification of certain Roman
characters and the introduction of one Greek character. This occurred
from the fact that Mr. Gatschet’s material had been partly prepared
prior to the adoption of the alphabet now in use.</p>

<p>Mr. Gatschet has collected much valuable material relating to
governmental and social institutions, mythology, religion, music,
poetry, oratory, and other interesting matters. The body of Klamath
literature, or otherwise the text previously mentioned, constitutes the
basis of these investigations.</p>


<h5>STUDIES AMONG THE IROQUOIS, BY MRS. E. A. SMITH<ins class =
"correction" title = ". missing">.&nbsp;</ins></h5>

<p>Mrs. Smith, of Jersey City, has undertaken to prepare a series of
chrestomathies of the Iroquois language, and has already made much
progress. Three of them are ready for the printer, and that on the
Tuscarora language has been increased much beyond the limits at first
established. She has also collected interesting material relating to the
mythology, habits, customs, &amp;c., of these Indians, and her
contributions will be interesting and important.</p>


<h5>WORK BY PROF. OTIS T. MASON.</h5>

<p>On the advent of the white man in America a great number of tribes
were found. For a variety of reasons the nomenclature
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
<a name = "pagexxiii" id = "pagexxiii"> </a>
of these tribes became excessively complex. Names were greatly
multiplied for each tribe and a single name was often inconsistently
applied to different tribes. Several important reasons conspired to
bring about this complex state of synonymy:</p>

<p>1st. A great number of languages were spoken, and ofttimes the first
names obtained for tribes were not the names used by themselves, but the
names by which they were known to some other tribes.</p>

<p>2d. The governmental organization of the Indians was not understood,
and the names for gentes, tribes, and confederacies were confounded.</p>

<p>3d. The advancing occupancy of the country by white men changed the
habitat of the Indians, and in their migrations from point to point
their names were changed.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the nomenclature of Indian tribes became
ponderous and the synonymy complex. To unravel this synonymy is a task
of great magnitude. Early in the fiscal year the materials already
collected on this subject were turned over to Professor Mason and
clerical assistance given him, and he has prepared a card catalogue of
North American tribes, exhibiting the synonymy, for use in the office.
This is being constantly revised and enlarged, and will eventually be
published.</p>

<p>Professor Mason is also engaged in editing a grammar and dictionary
of the Chata language, by the late Rev. Cyrus Byington, the manuscript
of which was by Mrs. Byington turned over to the Bureau of Ethnology.
The dictionary is Chata-English, and Professor Mason has prepared an
English-Chata of about ten thousand words. He has also undertaken to
enlarge the grammar by a further study of the language among the Indians
themselves.</p>


<h5>THE STUDY OF GESTURE SPEECH, BY BREVET LIEUT. COL. GARRICK MALLERY,
U.S.A.</h5>

<p>The growth of the languages of civilized peoples in their later
stages may be learned from the study of recorded literature;
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
<a name = "pagexxiv" id = "pagexxiv"> </a>
and by comparative methods many interesting facts may be discovered
pertaining to periods anterior to the development of writing.</p>

<p>In the study of peoples who have not passed beyond the tribal
condition, laws of linguistic growth anterior to the written stage may
be discovered. Thus, by the study of the languages of tribes and the
languages of nations, the methods and laws of development are discovered
from the low condition represented by the most savage tribe to the
highest condition existing in the speech of civilized man. But there is
a development of language anterior to this&mdash;a prehistoric
condition&mdash;of profound interest to the scholar, because in it the
beginnings of language&mdash;the first steps in the organization of
articulate speech&mdash;are involved.</p>

<p>On this prehistoric stage, light is thrown from four sources:</p>

<p>1st. Infant speech, in which the development of the language of the
race is epitomized.</p>

<p>2d. Gesture speech, which, among tribal peoples, never passes beyond
the first stages of linguistic growth; and these stages are probably
homologous to the earlier stages of oral speech.</p>

<p>3d. Picture writing, in which we again find some of the
characteristics of prehistoric speech illustrated.</p>

<p>4th. It may be possible to learn something of the elements of which
articulate speech is compounded by studying the inarticulate language of
the lower animals.</p>

<p>The traits of gesture speech that seem to illustrate the condition of
prehistoric oral language are found in the synthetic character of its
signs. The parts of speech are not differentiated, and the sentence is
not integrated; and this characteristic is more marked than in that of
the lowest oral language yet studied. For this reason the facts of
gesture speech constitute an important factor in the philosophy of
language. Doubtless, care must be exercised in its use because of the
advanced mental condition of the people who thus express their thought,
but with due caution it may be advantageously used. In itself,
independent of its relations to oral speech, the subject is of great
interest.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
<a name = "pagexxv" id = "pagexxv"> </a>
<p>In taking up this subject for original investigation, valuable
published matter was found for comparison with that obtained by Colonel
Mallery. His opportunities for collecting materials from the Indians
themselves were abundant, as delegations of various tribes are visiting
Washington from time to time, by which the information obtained during
his travels was supplemented.</p>

<p>Again, the method of investigation by the assistance of a number of
collaborators is well illustrated in this work, and contributions from
various sources were made to the materials for study. The methods of
obtaining these contributions will be more fully explained hereafter.
One of the papers appended to this report was prepared by Colonel
Mallery and relates to this subject.</p>

<p>During the continuance of the Survey of the Colorado River, and of
the Rocky Mountain Region, the Director and his assistants made large
collections of pictographs. When Colonel Mallery joined the corps these
collections were turned over to him for more careful study. From various
sources these pictographs are rapidly accumulating, and now the subject
is assuming large proportions, and valuable results are expected.</p>

<p>An interesting relation between gesture speech and pictography
consists in the discovery that to the delineation of natural objects is
added the representation of gesture signs<ins class = "correction" title
= ". missing">. </ins>Materials in America are very abundant, and the
prehistoric materials may be studied in the light given by the practices
now found among Indian tribes.</p>


<h5>STUDIES IN CENTRAL AMERICAN PICTURE WRITING, BY PROF. E. S.
HOLDEN.</h5>

<p>In Central America and Mexico, picture writing had progressed to a
stage far in advance of anything discovered to the northward. Some of
the most interesting of these are the rock inscriptions of Yucatan,
Copan, Palenque, and other ruins of Central America.</p>

<p>Professor Holden has devoted much time to the study of
<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
<a name = "pagexxvi" id = "pagexxvi"> </a>
these inscriptions, for the purpose of discovering the characteristics
of the pictographic method and deciphering the records, and the
discoveries made by him are of great interest.</p>

<p>The Bureau has given him clerical assistance and such other aid as
has been found possible, and a paper by him on this subject appears with
this volume.</p>


<h5>THE STUDY OF MORTUARY CUSTOMS, BY DR. H. C. YARROW.</h5>

<p>The tribes of North America do not constitute a homogeneous people.
In fact, more than seventy distinct linguistic stocks are discovered,
and these are again divided by important distinctions of language. Among
these tribes varying stages of culture have been reached, and these
varying stages are exhibited in their habits and customs; and in a
territory of such vast extent the physical environment affecting culture
and customs is of great variety. Forest lands on the one hand, prairie
lands on the other, unbroken plains and regions of rugged mountains, the
cold, naked, desolate shores of sea and lake at the north and the dense
chaparral of the torrid south, the valleys of quiet rivers and the
cliffs and gorges of the cañon land&mdash;in all a great diversity of
physical features are found, imposing diverse conditions for obtaining
subsistence, in means and methods of house-building, creating diverse
wants and furnishing diverse ways for their supply. Through diversities
of languages and diversities of environment, diversity of traditions and
diversity of institutions have been produced; so that in many important
respects one tribe is never the counterpart of another.</p>

<p>These diversities have important limitations in the unity of the
human race and the social, mental, and moral homogeneity that has
everywhere controlled the progress of culture. The way of human progress
is one road, though wide.</p>

<p>From the interesting field of research cultivated by Dr. Yarrow an
abundant harvest will be gathered. The materials already accumulated are
large, and are steadily increasing through his vigorous work. These
materials constitute something
<span class = "pagenum">xxvii</span>
<a name = "pagexxvii" id = "pagexxvii"> </a>
more than a record of quaint customs and abhorrent rites in which morbid
curiosity may revel. In them we find the evidences of traits of
character and lines of thought that yet exist and profoundly influence
civilization. Passions in the highest culture deemed most
sacred&mdash;the love of husband and wife, parent and child, and kith
and kin, tempering, beautifying, and purifying social life and
culminating at death, have their origin far back in the early history of
the race and leaven the society of savagery and civilization alike<ins
class = "correction" title = ". invisible">. </ins>At either end of the
line bereavement by death tears the heart and mortuary customs are
symbols of mourning. The mystery which broods over the abbey where lie
the bones of king and bishop, gathers over the ossuary where lie the
bones of chief and <ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">shamin</ins>; for the same longing to solve the mysteries of
life and death, the same yearning for a future life, the same awe of
powers more than human, exist alike in the mind of the savage and the
sage.</p>

<p>By such investigations we learn the history of culture in these
important branches, and in a paper appended to this report Dr. Yarrow
presents some of the results of his studies.</p>


<h5>INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO CESSIONS OF LAND BY INDIAN TRIBES TO THE
UNITED STATES, BY C. C. ROYCE.</h5>

<p>When civilized man first came to America the continent was partially
occupied by savage tribes, who obtained subsistence by hunting, by
fishing, by gathering vegetal products, and by rude garden culture in
cultivating small patches of ground. Semi-nomadic occupancy for such
purposes was their tenure to the soil.</p>

<p>On the organization of the present government such theories of
natural law were entertained that even this imperfect occupancy was held
to be sufficient title. Publicists, jurists, and statesmen agreed that
no portion of the waste of lands between the oceans could be acquired
for the homes of the incoming civilized men but by purchase or conquest
in just war. These theories were most potent in establishing practical
relations,
<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>
<a name = "pagexxviii" id = "pagexxviii"> </a>
and controlling governmental dealings with Indian tribes. They were
adjudged to be dependent domestic nations.</p>

<p>Under this theory a system of Indian affairs grew up, the history of
which, notwithstanding mistakes and innumerable personal wrongs, yet
demonstrates the justice inherent in the public sentiment of the nation
from its organization to the present time.</p>

<p>The difficulties subsisting in the adjustment of rights between
savage and civilized peoples are multiform and complex. Ofttimes the
virtues of one condition are the crimes of the other; happiness is
misery; justice, injustice. Thus, when the civilized man would do the
best, he gave the most offense. Under such circumstances it was
impossible for wisdom and justice combined to avert conflict.</p>

<p>One chapter in the history of Indian affairs in America is a doleful
tale of petty but costly and cruel wars; but there are other chapters
more pleasant to contemplate.</p>

<p>The attempts to educate the Indians and teach them the ways of
civilization have been many; much labor has been given, much treasure
expended. While to a large extent all of these efforts have disappointed
their enthusiastic promoters, yet good has been done, but rather by the
personal labors of missionaries, teachers, and frontiersmen associating
with Indians in their own land than by institutions organized and
supported by wealth and benevolence not immediately in contact with
savagery.</p>

<p>The great boon to the savage tribes of this country, unrecognized by
themselves, and, to a large extent, unrecognized by civilized men, has
been the presence of civilization, which, under the laws of
acculturation, has irresistibly improved their culture by substituting
new and civilized for old and savage arts, new for old customs&mdash;in
short, transforming savage into civilized life. These unpremeditated
civilizing influences have had a marked effect. The great body of the
Indians of North America have passed through stages of culture in the
last hundred years achieved by our Anglo-Saxon ancestors only by the
slow course of events through a thousand years.</p>

<p>The Indians of the continent have not greatly diminished

in numbers, and the tribes longest in contact with civilization are
increasing. The whole body of Indians is making rapid progress toward a
higher culture, notwithstanding the petty conflicts yet occurring where
the relations of the Indian tribes to our civilization have not yet been
adjusted by the adoption upon their part of the first conditions of a
higher life.</p>

<p>The part which the General Government, representing public sentiment,
has done in the extinguishment of the vague Indian title to lands in the
granting to them of lands for civilized homes on reservations and in
severalty, in the establishment and support of schools, in the endeavors
to teach them agriculture and other industrial arts&mdash;in these and
many other ways justice and beneficence have been shown. Thus the
history of the tribes of America from savagery to civilization is a
history of three:</p>

<p>First. The history of acculturation&mdash;the effect of the presence
of civilization upon savagery.</p>

<p>Second. The history of Indian wars that have arisen in part from the
crimes and in part from the ignorance of either party.</p>

<p>Third. The history of civil Indian affairs. This last is divided into
a number of parts:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p>1st. The extinguishment of the Indian title.</p>

<p>2d. The gathering of Indians upon reservations.</p>

<p>3d. The instrumentalities used to teach the Indians civilized
industries; and</p>

<p>4th. The establishment and operation of schools.</p>
</div>

<p>From the organization of the Government to the present time these
branches of Indian affairs have been in operation; lands have been
bought and bought again; Indian tribes have been moved and moved again;
reservations have been established and broken up. The Government has
sought to give lands in severalty to the Indians from time to time along
the whole course of the history of Indian affairs. Every experiment to
teach the Indians the industries of civilization that could be devised
has been tried, and from all of these there has resulted a mixture of
failure and success.</p>

<p>A review of the century’s history abundantly demonstrates that there
is no short road to justice and peace; but a glance
<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
<a name = "pagexxx" id = "pagexxx"> </a>
at the present state of affairs exhibits the fact that these tribal
communities will speedily be absorbed in the citizenship of the
republic. No new method is to be adopted; the work is almost done;
patient and persistent effort for a short future like that of the long
past will accomplish all. It remains for us but to perfect the work
wisely begun by the founders of the Government.</p>

<p>The industries and social institutions of the pristine Indians have
largely been destroyed, and they are groping their way to civilized
life. To the full accomplishment of this, three things are
necessary:</p>

<p>1st. The organization of the civilized family, with its rules of
inheritance in lineal descent.</p>

<p>2d. The civilized tenure of property in severalty must be substituted
for communal property.</p>

<p>3d. The English language must be acquired, that the thoughts and ways
of civilization may be understood.</p>

<p>To the history of Indian affairs much time has been given by the
various members of the Bureau of Ethnology. One of the more important of
these studies is that prosecuted by Mr. Royce in preparing a history of
the cessions of lands by Indian tribes to the Government of the United
States. A&nbsp;paper by him appended to this report illustrates the
character of these investigations.</p>


<h5>EXPLORATIONS BY MR. JAMES STEVENSON.</h5>

<p>In the early exploration of the southwestern portion of the United
States by Spanish travelers and conquerors, about sixty pueblos were
discovered. These pueblos were communal villages, with architecture in
untooled stone. In the conquest about half of the pueblos were
destroyed. Thirty-one now remain, and two of these are across the line,
on Mexican territory. The ruins of the pueblos yet remain, and some of
them have been identified.</p>

<p>The Navajos, composed of a group of tribes of the Athabascan family,
and the Coaninis, who live on the south side of
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
<a name = "pagexxxi" id = "pagexxxi"> </a>
the Grand Cañon of the Colorado, are now known to be the people, or part
of them at least, who were driven from the pueblos.</p>

<p>In addition to the ruins that have been made in historic times,
others are found scattered throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Southern
California, Utah, and Colorado. Whether the ancient inhabitants of these
older ruins are represented by any of the tribes who now occupy the
territory is not known. These pueblo people were not homogeneous. Among
the pueblos now known at least five linguistic families are represented,
but in their study a somewhat homogeneous stage of culture is
presented.</p>

<p>In a general way the earlier or older ruins represent very rude
structures, and the progress of development from the earlier to the
later exhibits two classes of interesting facts. The structures
gradually increase in size and improve in architecture. As the sites for
new villages were selected, more easily defensible positions were
chosen. The cliff dwellings thus belong to the later stage.</p>

<p>From the organization of the exploration of the Colorado River to the
present time, the pueblos yet inhabited, as well as those in ruins, have
been a constant subject of study, and on the organization of the Bureau
much valuable matter had already been collected. Early in the fiscal
year a party was organized to continue explorations in this field, and
placed under the direction of Mr. James Stevenson. The party left
Washington on the first of August last.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank H. Cushing, of the Smithsonian Institution, and Mr.
J.&nbsp;K. Hillers, photographer of the Bureau, with a number of general
assistants, accompanied Mr. Stevenson. The party remained in the field
until early winter, studying the ruins and making large and valuable
collections of pottery, stone implements, etc., and Mr. Hillers
succeeded in making an excellent suite of photographs.</p>

<p>When Mr. Stevenson returned with his party to Washington, Mr. Cushing
remained at Zuñi to study the language, mythology, sociology, and art of
that the most interesting pueblo. An illustrated catalogue of the
collections made by Mr. Stevenson
<span class = "pagenum">xxxii</span>
<a name = "pagexxxii" id = "pagexxxii"> </a>
has been printed. It was intended to form an appendix to this report,
but the volume has grown to such a size that it is thought best to issue
it with the next report.</p>


<h5>RESEARCHES AMONG THE WINTUNS, BY J. W. POWELL.</h5>

<p>During the fall the Director made an expedition into Northern
California for the purpose of studying the Wintuns. Much linguistic,
sociologic, and technologic material was collected, and more thorough
anthropologic researches initiated among a series of tribes heretofore
neglected.</p>


<h5>THE PREPARATION OF MANUALS FOR USE IN AMERICAN RESEARCH.</h5>

<p>In the second plan of operations adopted by the Bureau, that of
promoting the researches of collaborators, aid in publication and, to
some extent, in preparation of scientific papers, has been given, and by
various ways new investigations and lines of research have been
initiated. For this latter purpose a series of manuals with elementary
discussions and schedules of interrogatories have been prepared.</p>

<p>The first is entitled Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages,
by J.&nbsp;W. Powell.</p>

<p>This has been widely distributed throughout North America, and the
collection of a large body of linguistic material has resulted
therefrom.</p>

<p>A second volume of this character is entitled Introduction to the
Study of Mortuary Customs, by Dr. H.&nbsp;C. Yarrow.</p>

<p>This also has been widely circulated with abundant success.</p>

<p>A third hand-book of the same character is entitled Introduction to
the Study of Sign Language, by Colonel Mallery.</p>

<p>This was circulated in like manner with like results.</p>

<p>A second edition of the Introduction to the Study of Indian
Languages, enlarged to meet the advanced wants of the time, has been
prepared.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxxiii</span>
<a name = "pagexxxiii" id = "pagexxxiii"> </a>
<p>The papers by Dr. Yarrow and Colonel Mallery, and the catalogue of
manuscripts in the Bureau, prepared by Mr. Pilling, appended to this
volume, will illustrate the value of these agencies.</p>

<p>It is proposed in the near future to prepare similar volumes, as
follows:</p>

<p>Introduction to the Study of Medicine Practices of the North American
Indians;</p>

<p>Introduction to the Study of the Tribal Governments of North
America;</p>

<p>Introduction to the Study of North American Mythology.</p>

<p>These additional manuals are nearly ready. Still others are
projected, and it is hoped that the field of North American anthropology
will be entirely covered by them. The series will then be systematically
combined in a Manual of Anthropology for use in North America.</p>


<h5>SYSTEMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN TRIBES.</h5>

<p>There is in course of preparation by the Bureau a linguistic
classification of North American tribes, with an atlas exhibiting their
priscan homes, or the regions inhabited by them at the time they were
discovered by white men.</p>


<p>The foregoing sketch of the Bureau, for the first fiscal year of its
existence, is designed to set forth the plan on which it is organized
and the methods of research adopted, and the papers appended thereto
will exhibit the measure of success attained.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of the Bureau of Ethnology to organize
anthropologic research in America<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<h5>Errors and Inconsistencies</h5>

<p>Typographical errors are shown in the text with <ins class =

missing commas within or before entries were silently supplied.
Differences in punctuation or hyphenization between the Table of
Contents, Index, or List of Illustrations, and the item itself, are not
noted. Irregularities that are specific to an individual article are
noted at the beginning of the article.</p>

<h5>Illustrations</h5>

<p>For this e-text, Plates were rescaled to 25% by pixel count, while
most Figures were rescaled to 33%. The original is strongly sepia-toned,
so the distinction between color and grayscale reflects the
transcriber’s judgement rather than a clear difference in the
original.</p>

half-length drawings of named or namable sources. On the principle of

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
